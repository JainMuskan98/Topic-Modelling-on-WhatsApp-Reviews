2,"Since the last 2-3 updates, the application works the same but the bottom part with the emoticons is different, it takes up a lot of space and after you write and hit enter you no longer see the written message, you have to go back so that the space where you wrote disappears to see actually what you wrote. It's annoying to make two extra moves to check what you wrote. Please return to the way it was before. It was simple and beautiful. Thank you"
4,There's no feature to share my screen. Update 1/14/2023 Can you please make it possible to share my screen during video chat? It would be much appreciated. Thank you so much. Update: Changed my review to 4 stars ü§© They added the screen recording feature! The only downside that I have to deal with still is that in order to connect the bluetooth earpiece you have to disconnect the call and then call the person back if you didn't have it connected prior to the call. It's so annoying!
2,"The app tries to improve, but takes a step backwards with each update. The app has had a good track record. If only the app did not become more and more buggy with each update. They have added really cool features that do improve the app. Some not so much. For example, the emoji panel. They've changed the placement of the ""delete"" key, and was replaced by the flags icon. For a long term user (most of us) this is incredibly annoying. So much more, but I'm at my word limit."
1,"After the last update it's a nightmare! I am typing a message and I want to add a yellow smiley, but when I click on it, all the stickers open, if I click to smiles after that, the smiley is inserted in the middle of the text and in the middle of the word and not at the end of text! I hate the new version! Return the old one or fix this bug so that it was like before! it's annoying! The software tester is terrible and needs to relearn his profession!"
2,"Switching phones is not easy with this app. I don't like how you can't have two or more devices logged in at once, like Telegram. Also, i can't get the transfer chat feature to work, and then i don't see an option to try again after it fails. And then, when trying to do backup google drive, when i try to log on to a new device, the option to restore chats is not presented. Why is this so complicated?"
1,"The return button on the keyboard is missing. This is a important feature that WhatsApp seemed to have taken from the keyboard. I have two options to send a message, but if I need to break a message up, I can no longer do that. This one feature has pissed me all the way off, especially when I'm not the type to leave reviews at all! Return this feature back as soon as possible."
3,"I'm noticing the app continues to increase in internal storage. I also notice that its becoming more buggy with each update. I'm seeing the same thing happening with Telegram too. I think these 2 rivals are competing to see who can provide better features (even though telegram takes the win on that one), rather than to fix the stability of their own apps. Eventually they'll address the complaints about stability, but when?"
1,"Exceptionally horrible! Forces close. Freezes. Won't send my videos. Won't let you change gallery, photo, or notification settings. I tried to add a friend's number (mexican) wouldn't allow it unless he was in my phone's contacts; seriously! The whole point is to be able to use it Internationally. Waste of time. üëåüèæ"
1,"I wasn't sure if I trusted the other reviews, so I tried it anyway. You really do have to add your contacts and add new people to contacts to use it, which kind of defeats the original purpose because you might as well just dial their number and call them. Meta clearly wanted to turn a simple encripted communications app into a full-fledged social network, whether you and everyone you know wants to be included or not. Lucking, better communications apps are now available. You don't need this."
2,"duh! how many users have actually asked for this change of UI? why do you need to change something that worked just fine for years and years, is beyond my understanding. App Design isnt about ""fancy new looks every month"" but user friendliness and intuitiveness while using the app - that scores quite high. Now the speed of ""creating a message"" is greatly compromised cause ""Someone"" felt the urge to play with app's interface. Good job you guysü´§#byebyeintuitive #wheredidthisbuttongo!?"
4,"Love it!! Easy to use, great voice calls, great stickers, only thing is you need to add more shape variety for avatar, say for upside down pear shaped women and truer blonde hair color and maybe headbands or barrettes, but it is a super app. Thanks for making it fun to use!! It is very annoying when you click on an emoji expecting 1 thing and get something completely different,"
1,"It has been extremely buggy for the last few months. The biggest problem lies within the media files. I download an image, try to tap on it to open, it goes back to being an undownloaded image. I tap again, the same. Cannot view the image at all. Image appears multiple times in gallery, but not in WhatsApp. Tapping on it simply redownloads the image. Also, swiping up to see older messages in a conversation teleports you to a random location in the past. Please work on the media fix soon. Thanks."
1,"Good day, I hope you are well. Unfortunately, I have also been experiencing the issues with the text box jumping around and not moving down with the text being typed on the next line (especially when I type emojis) so that I can see what I am typing. When I highlight a previous message, my keybord also doesn't automatically pop up as it usually did...This version is extremely irritating because of this. Could you please fix it as soon as possible? Thank you so very much in advance! Kind regards"
3,"The app works as it should for the most part, you can't really complain about calls and chats. One recent feature update worsened the user experience significantly, however: The new emoji/sticker/etc. organization is frankly horrible and I don't see any reason why the old one should have been changed, as it worked perfectly fine. The new one is clunky and glitchy and simply is not optimized for ease of use. This is especially noticeable with the stickers. Atleast let us choose between displays."
5,"You are rolling out the reactions to messages feature, which is good. Could you please introduce the Double Tap feature too, like in Instagram? It is much needed. Also, it would be great if you keep the ""Disappearing Messages"" customisable for both the parties. One should be able to keep the feature off for themselves while the other one keeps it on for him/her and vice versa. Also the duration for the same should be customisable as per preference"
1,"The latest update is terrible. The way they restructured the stickers, emojis, gifs panel was unnecessary and slows down productivity when typing, also it randomly covers half of the screen, they also moved the delete button from the bottom right to the top right when accessing these features. If it's not broken don't try to fix it! The ability to play a message that comes in as an audio as a drop down notification is much more needed. Worst update ever!"
2,"Sometimes I experience a glitch where I don't see a call history or even evidence of a concluded call. Also I don't like the new pattern of the status update, no search button and the horizontal arrangement is unfavorable. I miss a lot of important statuses, kindly revert back to the vertical arrangement that allows easy selection of which status to view. Plus I don't like the whole space the other channels are taking. when there are other platforms for these. WhatsApp was my safe space."
5,"In my last review, I asked you to add a feature that allows us to send audio to status and you granted it. THANKS A LOT, YOU'RE THE BEST! And the sharescreen feature is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. Now I have another cool idea: what if you add a new feature called Close Friends List? That way we can choose who to share our statuses and profile picture with. This feature will make WhatsApp becomes even more private too, which is cool. I hope you notice this. Thanks in advance."
3,"What's exactly the use of this new update that introduces channels and a new interface for status? Are you trying to copy Telegram? Please, it is not worth it! Kindly revert to your former unique style. That's what we love. Every platform has its own uniqueness. Don't lose yours while searching for another outside. This is what makes you original. You may lose followers/users if you fail to listen to these grumblings of ours here. Return the search button on Status and others. Thank you. ü•Çüôè"
1,"The updates should be called downgrades. Once I'm off a call, my volume button just doesn't work. I have tried and tested it multiple times. It is extremely frustrating. Furthermore, I cannot remember the last time I had a decent video call. It is NOT my internet as all other apps and the internet works perfectly, just whatsapp is a problem!"
4,"I love using whatsapp, but the recent update really annoys me. I don't like the updates menu UI which makes it harder for me to watch my friend's status. To put it bluntly, I don't like how I need to swipe it left and right to watch it and it looks very small. I hope it'll be changed tho. Maybe two drop-down menus which consisted of status and channels. We need to press it to show the whole status menu like before, so do the channels menu."
4,"An excellent app for communication. Makes communication much cheaper than phoning direct. As an improvement, I think having a function in the app, that makes it able to read out aloud messages would be a great. Many times I find myself demotivated when I have to read long messages on the small screen of my mobile phone, or when I want to direct my attention to other things at the same time"
1,"I have been using WhatsApp for years and gone through all kinds of updates, some more welcomed than others. This last one is a complete mess. The rearrangement of the emoji/gif/stickers tray make it extremely difficult to use, specially the stickers. Also, I don't need the channels. I have enough in IG and FB. Why taking ‚Öî of the screen in something I don't want? Put them in another tab. I want to be able to see my friend's status like before!"
1,"It used to be a good app. It has been long since it turned into a trash. It's my habit to delete the chat while the media, if I need it, I keep it. Now, too many times I lost all the media while deleting the chat and not ticking the ""delete Media also"" or sometimes deleting the media only while not ticking on the ""delete from media"" and yet I find nothing in my gallery. Finally, I found the motivation, even though ignoring it way many times, to give good rating to the app. Keep it up."
2,"The app itself is pretty stable and you can rely on the messages to arrive. This, of course, is also provided by other messaging apps. When it comes to messaging, I get pretty annoyed when I try to use emojis or gifs. This menu seems to be related to the iOS design - and it doesn't work well on Android (especially if you use gestures for system navigation). Additionally, the backup and recovery process is horrible. Moving to another phone, there's bound to be trouble with WhatsApp."
5,"Soo for a few months now, the call history on WhatsApp has been incorrect. A person calls you, and it takes hours for the call log to be updated, or you see it two hours later, and it's showing you that the call happened. ""Just now,"" Also ,status pictures are blurrrryyyyyy, not cute, I could swear I had seen a feature where you can share pictures in ""Hd"" if you chose, but I haven't seen it in a bit, I guess they took it out after the beta testing but it is a great feature"
5,"July 24, 2023 I like the app, overall. I did notice, however, in the latest update when using emojis, it causes the text input box to jump to the top of the screen, making the interface really awkward and sometimes frustrating to use. I'd also like to see an option to mute a video call. For example if you're chatting on a video call on loud speaker and suddenly need to mute the conversation temporarily. 84 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful?"
4,"I love this app and frequently use it as my main way of contacting friends and family. I like the fact that there are many different ways you can say what you want, whether through photos, voice messages, stickers, gifs, emojis, your status or just directly through a message. I also use the poll feature a lot, especially when trying to organize something with friends, and I want to see who can come or not. My only request/issue is that you can't edit messages after they have been sent."
4,"Great app for messaging and video chats and communication! The only issue now though is that there seems to be a slight app malfunction as far as the Bluetooth function for earpieces is involved. Two times now, the Bluetooth has spontaneously disconnected and I was not able to reconnect it while I was on a call. It could be that it's my own earpiece hardware, but I figured it would be worth mentioning anyway."
1,"Im so upset. From nowhere my app just crashed because it had a bug. Moments later it gave me an option to restore messages only to realize that I've lost messages from last week. Apparently my app hasn't been backing up messages for 8 days. I thought local backups where supposed to occur automatically! I won't even talk about how it compresses images to a bad quality. Update, my Whatsapp crashes multiple times. I'm so tired of losing important messages!"
5,"In fact, I like the application, but there are several features that I think are not quite right, such as the feature for deleting messages but still being notified that the message has been deleted, or the text editing feature but still being if the text has been edited and so on. So, maybe you can think more about the features for future development innovation üôèüèª"
4,"Most infuriating thing you've ever implemented to this app has been merging the voice recording button with video recording. It constantly switches when I don't mean to ""double click"" it and I absolutely hate it. We already had a recording feature. We didn't need a selfie recording merged with another button we constantly use. Infuriating and dumb! At LEAST allow us to remove this feature in settings please! Choose ""voice recording, video recording or both""."
1,"This messenger has some limitations that can be frustrating. For instance, the inability to log in while roaming due to SMS restrictions can be inconvenient. Additionally, migrating chat history between platforms and adjusting to the user interface might require some effort. While there are aspects that could be improved for a smoother experience, there's also a strong sense of disappointment with the current state of the app."
1,"Last update sucks. You screwed up Status, no I can't view my status in a list all at once or share them which would have allowed me to repost on my on status again without having to do other annoying steps like screenshot. Look, it is simple, remove the features that allow people to view one status in private (that is stalking) and two, allow Status to be either saved or pin. Simple. And Whatsapp channels should be optional."
2,"There's a bug with emoticons in the app since it changed two versions ago (I guess). When typing some text, if you start to insert emoticons there is no scroll down in the text line. And after sending the message, the messages do not scroll down. That is, the current message is not displayed, as well as the incoming ones after the sent message"
3,"Hi everyone. I think I have found a bug probably. I do not get message notifications anymore. The function, to turn it on, is.not available because my android system is outdated. Well, my android is up to date. There must be an other reason. I guess, or I hope, I am.not the only one with this issue and you are going to fix it. Thanks in advance!"
4,"I like WhatsApp, it's among the top instant messaging apps available. I have a suggestion for the next update: please consider adding a 'recycle bin' feature. This would prevent chats, voice notes, or other media from being permanently lost due to accidental deletions. For instance, my tutor recently lost over an hour's worth of lecture due to an unintentional tap on the delete button. Consider this suggestion please. EDIT: Users should be able to upload any recorded audio to their statusü§∑"
1,"You are rolling out the reaction to message, feature which is good. Could you please introduce the double tap feature too, like in Instagram? It is much needed. Also,it would we great if you keep the ""disappearing message"" Customisable for both the parties. One should be able to keep the feature off for themselves while the other on keeps it on for him/her and vice versa. Also the Duration fro the some should be customisable ise per preference"
2,"generally love this app, my only form of messaging! however, since the last update the emoji and gifs have been ruined. emoji tray is a nightmare and if you search a gif, it just shows you the ones that were there at the beginning when you try and click a search result .. then it freezes and you can't do anything! please fix this!! the emoji/gif layout was perfect before this .. better with the options at the bottom too!"
3,"I use this app for a lot of long distance video calls. Unfortunately, the quality of calls is very poor. For the past 10 days or so, this app has frozen within 5 to 10 seconds of making a call: only way to rectify this, is to cut call and dial it again. It will still freeze on subsequent calls and trying to speak to someone on a video which always freezes is completely frustrating. 03.0.23 In an average 50 minute call, WhatsApp is still freezing at least every 3 minutes for 2 to 3 seconds"
1,"I'm definitely not happy with the new updates. There's absolutely no need for channels or whatever (at least give us an option if we'd want to see those or not ). We already have enough of those on IG and FB. In addition to that, the horizontal arrangement of the status/statuses feels and looks weird. The vertical arrangement made WhatsApp different from other apps. Great app, not happy with updates though !"
1,"The new emoji picker interface is horrible. It makes everything worse than before, the worst being the vertical drawer slide animation which totally breaks the flow when typing. Who the hell did think that this could be a good idea? This has to be the most unergonomic and unpractical thing you could ever do, and you did it. Bravo! Now please revert back! Nobody asked for this. Don't fix what doesn't need to be fixed."
2,"I installed the app and was able to download backup and export chats from previous phone. However, now I cannot open the app. Whenever I tap on the app, the loading screen comes up for half a second before it takes me back to the apps menu screen. Have tried restarting and updating software, but nothing has worked. Please help, thanks."
5,"""WhatsApp is the ultimate messaging app! It's fast, secure, and the voice and video call quality is top-notch. A true essential for staying connected with loved ones."" ""WhatsApp is a lifesaver for global communication. It's intuitive, reliable, and its end-to-end encryption ensures my privacy. Simply the best messaging app out there!"" ""WhatsApp is the gold standard of messaging apps. With its constant updates and features like disappearing messages, it continues to impress. I couldn't imagine"
3,"The new keyboard design for stickers, emojis and gif is worse in term of user experience compared to the previous version. When using the search functionality, the focus stays on the text message and not the search bar, which does not make any sense. Please make heavier tests before applying those big changes instead of just giving the users a feeling of evolution. I personally don't see it as a progression."
5,"What I like about WhatsApp is that it changed so much from its release. I remember the times when you could only use the app for messaging and phone calls. Now - along with other features like status and stuff - you can do a lot more. I find especially helpful the abilities to react to and edit a message. Not to mention the choice not to use ads. I mean after you see ads literally everywhere and in every app, you want at least to message people in peace."
4,"The app is very helpful. I can chat with my friends and all messages are encrypted. But, I've been trying to update to the latest version and it's not working.. Oh wait, guess I had to clear up some cache from my storage, silly me :)But overall, it's very safe and easily accessible."
4,"Really good app, you can chat, call and more with friends, family members and even send yourself an message. After having this app for so long there not much to say. But it would be cool if you could change the colours of the app, like not only light and dark mode but also like colours of green, blue, red, yellow, pink and more. So I rlly like it but I wish you could just do more decorations and stuff."
2,"I enjoyed using the application until its recent update. Specifically, the Channel addition. This robs us of a simple and peaceful messaging app that allows us to interact with close friends. I honestly can't figure out why the channel feature was added, and I hope it's removed ASAP. There are numerous distracting and disorganised apps, and WhatsApp is gradually becoming one of them. I'll rather use other apps to follow people or events I am interested in rather than lose my privacy."
5,"I don't know why you did, but these changes have negatively affected the user experience. We can't search for statuses, can't view all statuses at once to select and delete. I also don't like the arrangement of emojis and stickers, but that's something one can get used to. Still consider breaking a video to several 30 seconds parts to make uploading videos on statuses/updates easier"
2,"Recently, I have been facing so many bugs and issues. This new feature of sending quick videos in the same button as the audio makes the experience so annoying. It simply switches to video instead of recording an audio. There is also a problem when a new line is created (while typing), sometimes, the line does not move down, so I can not read the last line. I have been a user since 2015. This is the first time I have had so many bugs at once."
2,"I just updated to the latest version and it's the worst update ever. I do multiple statuses per day and enjoyed glancing at the number of views all at once. Now that is no more; I have to go to the status itself to see the views. Also, I can't click on a specific status post as before which makes it difficult to share to other platforms. So frustrating and I wish you didn't touch the status part of the app. Make a quick update before I lose it. Frustrated user!"
1,"Please, if you are thinking of leaving the status you just changed to update there, add a ""SEARCH"" feature. I have many people's statuses, but I want to view just a particular one, do I have to scroll down for that person? Add a search button on the Update page. I know that you might be thinking that why can't I search for the person on my chat page and view the status from there. Well, the processes users takes to complete their goals are different."
2,We don't need channels in the new update. Let us send pictures and videos with the quality a as they come. At least give us the option to choose. The pictures and video quality are really bad after its been sent and it's really annoying. Fix this issue before adding other things.
4,Damb it took a while but WhatsApp's finally here for wear os. Everything's good and all except the photos. We can't see the photos properly. So can you guys add a full screen mode to view photos properly. Also in good quality. That'd be much appreciated. The syncing time is also quite long. Lowering it would also be a great improvement.
2,"I have seen the official's argument misleadingly claiming about privacy. Facebook ruins everything it touches. 2. i am frustrated with the inability to delete messages after their set time expires. 3. the images i want to attach takes a very long, very very long time to loadwas so easy to slide between tabs with left or right swipe. I had been using that feature for years and when you change the top tab to bottom and r previews to select the folder to look in to, to attach an image."
2,"WhatsApp was doing beautiful until the recent update. Channels are an unnecessary addition, and the fact that we cannot search for status updates is just torturous. Taking away the option to view status updates in list mode is just stressful. I feel WhatsApp is focusing on the wrong things. I think it would be better to focus on improving status update quality for voice, video, and images. Also, allowing people post full videos would be really cool, and adding more colours to the status texts."
5,"It's nice, if I could add a feature I'd probably add a screen share feature while videocalling. Edit: There's a screen share feature now but you can't hear the audio coming from their device, you can only hear their microphone as usual. It's still a great addition nonetheless :) Also the videocall on laptop is very clunky, when I pick up on laptop the ringtone keeps going and the audio doesn't work on both sides"
3,"I think the best part of any app is the customizability of the app, and WhatsApp is popular because of all the features it has. Moving forward I'd like to be able to edit my settings whether or not it should show redundant messages like; forwarded, edited deleted or at least make it collapsible over time just to make chats neater. Thank you."
2,"Whatsapp's been great on phones. But on PC, the older version where you need to have your phone to be online, is way better and more reliable. The new version has the new UI and all, but it's been a downgrade in a user experience perspective from time to time. No audio when sending video, crashing, slow performance even on a good hardware (8 Core 16 Thread CPU, 16GB of RAM). Edit: Please, stop making pointless UI changes. The new animation when opening the emoticon menu is pointless and slugish."
5,"I really rated this app because I could message in different languages. A real bonus when travelling abroad.There was an option which translated as I typed. However, I've just got a new phone, transferred all my stuff but WhatsApp doesn't transfer my chat history, has lost some contacts and hasn't got a translate option. I'm off to France , now, in tears! So, a year on and we've both got better. I've managed to save my chat history as text documents and the translate option works well."
1,"The app is getting worse. Before the updates, this was my favourite messaging app. It was easy to use and efficient. Now, it has become annoying. I hate the channels tab and the layout for the emoji, gif and sticker section makes it hard to navigate compared to before. It's also laggy. Another issue i have is with the statuses. Now i have go through each of my post to delete it. So much hassle. Not sure why the app's quality decreases with every update instead of getting better."
3,"The new emoji tray is just horrible. It clashes with gesture controls and i keep minimizing whatsapp trying to grip the tray, it just adds steps to the process, the emoji search function layout is different from the gif search layout and takes you out of the new layout. Its all a mess. Either revert back or make the tray to be already expanded when you tap on the emoji button on the message bar. Edit: seems to be better now. Not sure if it was a bug or an update got installed."
3,"The bugs have been progressively increasing for the past one year. There is a weird bug while scrolling up the chats whereby it scrolls up to 2 or 3 days earlier instead of the recent chats. I suggest you prioritise squashing your bugs rather than providing new features. The app is getting less stable by the day. The community feature you introduced wasn't necessary, in my opinion. Status has become less stable recently."
1,"New features keep getting implemented without the users' input. ""Communities"" was first. I don't have any use for it so it just stays blank. But at least it is its own separate tab. Then there's ""Channels."" I do not want Telegram or Instagram on my phone, and Channels is just that. Worse is, you can't even disable it, it looks ugly and intrusive. It even interferes with the 3 dot menu on what used to be the ""Status"" tab. All I'm asking for is for a way to disable or hide it completely."
1,"The Missing Piece of WhatsApp Puzzle! I have always appreciated its simplicity and reliability. However, there was always one feature that seemed to be missing - the ability to schedule messages. üïíüöÄ Whether it's a reminder, a birthday greeting, or even a work-related message, WhatsApp's schedule feature has to develop because it is effortless to stay organized and maintain better communication with contacts. ‚åõüìùüí¨ Kindly do update üôè it ASAP."
1,"Update 30 Aug 2023: After working successfully for some time this same issue has started again. For over a week now chat backup stalls at 99% & will not complete. Cancelling to restart the backup adds an extra 25+MB to the file each time, so it takes longer & longer to get to that 99% point, only to stall yet again. ""Support"" is a joke. Its just an utterly useless chatbot. Going downhill rapidly. The app will not back up at all recently, so if anything happens to my phone I'm screwed."
3,I am very uncomfortable with allowing access to my contacts.. Mini of them are very proprietary to my business. NR phone number that cannot be shared with others. I find it annoying that it keeps asking the same question over and over. I will contact people when I feel. It is appropriate and I do not want blanket messages sent to my very large contacts list. Video of these people are very senior professionals in academia business end government.
5,"Best app. Thank for making communication easy and cheaper than before. One thing I would like though, is for you to allow sharing of anything (text, documents, media. Current you can only share documents and media. Text has to be copied and pasted into the app where you need to send it. But otherwise it's perfect. Kudos on the offline use.üëçüèøüíØüíØüíØ"
1,Unfortunately the latest update/upgrade has more annoyances than anything else. The attachment screen is weird and the size doesn't work well on a phone at all. The video/voice button is a disaster to say the least. It glitches and doesn't work. More often than not I have to close the app a few times coz the vn is running but not the recording so the app just hangs. Appreciate all the work you guys put it but the last batch isn't great. Please have the team relook the updates. Stay blessed.
1,"it was working properly and fine up until the last july update. now they forced me to update and it sucks, the new status features don't work properly and i cant select multiple status of mine to delete/copy, which was a big thing for me since i tend to write a lot of creative ideas on there. and the channels aren't even helpful, just busy the screen too much. supposed to be a social texting app and it tries to be something else that's not."
4,"I think the best part of any app is the customizability of the app, and WhatsApp is popular because of all the features it has. Moving forward I'd like to be able to edit my settings whether or not it should show redundant messages like; forwarded, edited deleted or at least make it collapsible over time just to make chats neater. Thank you."
4,"Great app, but I still think WhatsApp could fix the status sending. It would be nice if someone could set up something that will make it possible for the viewers to only see the status once. Bc sometimes it would definitely feel better if I know the viewers can't share or show the status I sent to other people without my permission. They would have to ask for permission to open the status and view it again. And I think it would be nice if we could ad music to videos, like on status or in a chat."
3,"App's working fine but the new sticker sorting sucks. When I want to use a favorite sticker, they start loading since THE FIRST sticker that I added and I hate A LOT of them. Before the update this didn't happen. Please, fix it so it can be as comfortable as it was before. Ah. An please fix that bug which when you're going up the conversarion it goes up a lot. It is disgusting."
4,"Pretty good and fast messaging app. I want to suggest a very cool update for video calls. It will help if users are able to type chats or send messages that appear on the video screen while the video call is still ongoing, to help solve the sound problems that normally occur during such calls."
5,Despite of the privacy controversy. It is still a very reliable messaging app. The app is stable with End-to-End encryption feature enabled by default. Its new PIN lock feature is great. It also has chat backup via Google Drive. Calls sounds clear and media shares are fast without sacrificing too much on quality. The app is easy to use. However sometimes notifications and calls tend to not show when device is on lock. It will be nice if the PIN lock is implemented before accessing the app
1,"Hi team, While doing video call screen auto rotation creating a bad experience. It's not really a good feature. The earlier one is the better one. Please roll back the changes that you have made for screen auto rotation feature for video calling. To reproduce the issue inhouse try to rotate your phone during video call and you will notice that the screen is getting cropped (not full screen view) which is really unwanted and irritating. Looking forward for the upcoming update with the roll back."
1,"It is a really good app, except after the update both on the handphone and the desktop, I cannot connect to whatsapp on the desktop (whether using phone's network or Wi-fi). Please help. Thank you Edit: After the latest update, whatsapp keeps crashing with error every time I try to open the chat room. Please help as it is quite annoying. Thank you"
3,"Good. Other than the buggy notifications. If I received a nessage on Android app, a notificayion appears on the lockscreen. If I then immediately read it on PC app, notification will disappear on Android, which is correct. But if the notification has been there for more than a few minutes, reading the message on PC will not make notification on Android go away. Very annoying!"
1,"For the longest time I've not been able to send videos on my whatsapp stories. All I get is ""can't send this video, choose a different video and try again."" and no, there's nothing wrong with the file. I have compressed, Changed file format, cleared cache...Even Uninstalled and reinstalled the app, yet nothing. Photos work perfectly, but I can't send videos at all. This is just so terrible. Even videos I make on my phone by myself don't upload. This is very annoying and you guys should fix up."
3,"Since the latest update, searching for stickers became quite difficult than before. When clicking another sticker pack, I would have to wait until the auto-scrolling's done instead of instantly being directed to the pack like before. Also, it takes quite a while for the stickers to load once selected. Another issue is the sections - Chats, Status, Communities and Calls - being at the bottom. I'd prefer if they stayed at the top as I keep mistakenly clicking them instead of the chats."
4,"The new version of Whatsapp is not very good because the options for call, status, etc, are now present below. The real problem is that the screen area is smaller than before, and if we have to find our relatives' contacts,we scroll like anything, and even it is taking more and not looking good. You are understanding the point, right? Your regular user"
3,"Overall good app, does it's purpose quite well. The only thing I absolutely hate about it is the new emoji and sticker format. It takes more time to load the emojis and it's just too many at one place. When they were split up into categories and you couldn't scroll through every single emoji it wasn't as overwhelming and confusing as it is now. (emojis also take longer to load now) The old one was better and I wish you would have kept it that way, not everything needs to be improved."
1,"The new sticker tray is incredibly hard to use if you have a lot of sticker packs. Making you scroll through hundreds of stickers to reach the pack you want is simply bad UX. Add to that the weird decision to have an aesthetic delay when switching from keyboard to the emote menu, something that's just downright annoying. Nobody is gonna think that that powerpoint slide transition is good, people will just wonder why they have to wait for it to be finished instead of it going seamlessly."
1,"Amazing app, so very useful for communication, but they just killed it adding the ""Channels"" service. Won't let me opt out either. Just when I thought I could text my friends and keep in touch with them without being distracted by a barrage of other media. WhatsApp, let us opt out of Channels. Please!"
2,"Over all functioning is brilliant but lately, there has been a issue in my whatsapp. I can't send voice messages. Like it's recording and all but when I tap 'send', it sends but there is no voice in it.... It's like a muted voice message. I told people about it they suggested to check if whatsapp has the permission to microphone, it has, they told me to update the whatsapp, i did but no improvement, they said maybe my phone is muted or some other problem, I checked it all. Please fix it soon.."
4,"This app is actually very good, but there're a couple things that are missing from it, it needs an auto-cut feature for statuses, like if I have a video longer than 30 seconds, it should automatically cut it into another status, or make the status time longer, same thing with videos sent in chat, I have videos longer than 3 minutes that I need to share. Also one more thing, I have updated whatsapp but it wont give me the new updates feature, why's that (it also crashes sometimes)"
3,"New keyboard animation is a nightmare! I'm sure some UX designer thought it would be really cool to have a nice animation when switching between the emoji and text keyboards but did anyone actually test this on a device to try and write a message?! It is so slow, it interrupts your flow when you're trying to write a message, and is driving me nuts! How annoying having to sit and watch the keyboard slide down and back up again just to add a smiley, then the whole process again to go back to text."
4,"Since a few months ago, there's been a strange problem! Some messages go to the last, some disappear, and when you search them, the text date is 1998! Many times I have uninstall it and reinstall it, and always I update it! But it's still there! Please do something about that! Otherwise there'll be no way to work with this!"
3,"The update is generally good, but it's not showing the upload progress, particularly when posting a status, you don't know how far the upload has progressed. I posted a status a couple of hours ago, and all it says is ""sending...... "" no option of cancelling the status to upload it afresh like when sending other media on chats. The only option is delete and that's very inconvenient."
1,"After the auto update for whatsapp, i kind of doesn't like when it added the channel because it make my phone too complicated and messier. I hope you can uhm remove the channel thingy.. But the good news is that i really like about the screen sharing on video call cause it make it easier to share something with friends, workers or colleagues. Oh and one more things, with the channel been added to whatsapp, to watch status and delete it, it is to complicated :D.. Thank you i think thats it"
2,"It works for the most part, but the ""transfer chats"" option doesn't work. I tried three times to transfer my chats, but there was a problem each time. I already tried submitting a report,but we all know that's useless. So if you were thinking of changing phones make sure your media is backed up some other way. (I also lost important pictures, videos and voice messages in the process)"
2,"It's very useful but quite a nuisance now and then. Updated review for this update: Emoji and sticker keyboard now unnecessarily difficult to use, would like it back how it used to be. Channels is awful. Just makes everything cluttered and busy. If I wanted to follow celebrities I could do that on every other social media already. And now status updates from my contacts even get hidden, as if they are less important than these channels that I'm being recommended but don't even follow."
4,"Love how the app keeps improving each passing year with new features. But, it would be great if you guys could add the following features in the next update: 1. Private/view once status I know it sounds a bit weird, but it would be nice having this feature. I think it would even be better if you could set a timer of a status before it disappeared. Instead of waiting 24hours, we could set the timer to be 5minutes, 10minutes and so on. 2. Inbuilt text/chat games (a must) eg hangman, chess, cards"
1,"Worst customer support system, which makes app useless. Got locked out for using in-flight wifi. I paid for what's app many years ago. I use it for contact with elderly family and school groups for my kid. Short of getting a new phone number after 15 years, I have no idea what to do. Support services send the same auto-reply over and over. Absolutely terrible. No option to call or escalate for assistance."
3,"For this newest version, i really love how big change is and new features. But one thing i don't really like, the backspace button while choosing emoji/gif/stickers moved on the top, so it's really hard if we want to do fast typing while changing from keyboard (that usually backspace in the bottom) to emoji select that the backspace button on the top. It's making me slower to type & give some emoji. Please put back the backspace button in the bottom again & I'll change it to 5 stars"
3,"It is an app that I use a lot to tell the truth, but there are many things that stress me out, for example sometimes in a group I don't know they send my messages but in a private chat yes, and it has happened to me several times, I also don't like that the quality of many images and videos drops when sending them, or even that it gets too stuck to the point that the messages stop coming, I would like that in a Future these things will change (add the everyone option for a group ü´¢), tkns"
1,"WhatsApp's backup systems are severely lacking. When transitioning from an Android device to iOS, and even in certain instances on Android itself, all of your chats and media are lost. It is imperative to establish a system where data backup is not just an option but an absolute necessity for users. It is incredibly distressing and frustrating to lose a crucial chat after switching devices. In contrast, Telegram offers the convenience of unrestricted usage and eliminates the burden of restoring"
2,"Hai , Recently i installed WhatsApp. I have find some bugs. the bugs like i don't send voice message. After send voice message. i don't hear my voice message. because it's look comes like recording, recording, recording. I hate this and I have try lots of time uninstall and install. but this problem have comes. please help and solve this problem."
2,"No problems with the app whatsoever, except that I'd like to have separate subfolders in WhatsApp Images, etc for every chat I have, so I don't have to back up the entire WhatsApp images folder Also can we somehow make the local backup take place in the background please? I hate not being able to use my phone while it's backing up."
1,"One of the most used chat app within my friends. However, the last updates worsened the chat experience by introducing useless animation in the keyboard. The switch between normal keyboard and emoji keyboard now has a sliding animation that takes about 1 second. It is extremely annoying. That animation is useless. I expect that none was asking for it. When I want to write a message in a chat, I want to do it quickly, without fancy sliding keyboards."
1,"Functional, but once it takes up space, I would want to store its data to SD card. However, this is not possible because WhatsApp won't let you. If you do manually more them to SD card, the pictures, videos, stickers, and GIFs disappear in the chats. I'm very disappointed. Also, sometimes messages do not reach me unless I open the app."
1,"This issue has been ongoing for a long time, I think any update issue but there is a problem in the app and it's affecting my ability to use the app efficiently. I have tried WhatsApp is taking a lot of time to load, even if I try to forward anything, even a single message, it's also taking a lot of time, but the problem persists. I am using WhatsApp on Vivo v17 with 8gb ram and 256 rom with the latest version of the app installed. I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter."
3,"This app is a wonderful platform. After the last two update, some features dosent perform well for me. The video call - the auto-rotation makes bad viewing experiance, which was perfect before. In group calls the other end persons frame get croped. The call log - the recent call are not mentioned when we check after a call is done, some time it shows the call which actually was done 1 or 2 hrs before is done in 1 min before in call log. Which makes it difficult to check when a call was done."
3,"The app and its functionality is very good. Finally being able to send pictures in HD is a great improvement! However, the new emoji functionality is very slow and takes up way too much space. When inserting the emoji, the message sometimes disappears behind the keyboard. Please fix!"
1,"I most of gotten the most annoying bug from this app. Which one? Let me see when I type a word it lacks a few seconds to appear, that's not the worst. When I get a message the notification sound branded to whatsapp keeps ringing as if im getting 20K messages at once. Extremely annoying frustrating to say the very very least. Not even closing the app or Uninstalling it makes a difference. I have to restart my phone or turn it off completely to stop the annoying sound. Please fix it s23 ultra"
4,"I think Whatsapp is a great app, and is the No. 1 communication app...in my country at least. But the latest update where the positions of the emojis and GIFs have been completely switched to the opposite is really frustrating üò≠ we have gotten used to the previous position after using Whatsapp for so many years. To change it now is really just...why? Would be great is Whatsapp could revert the emoji panel to its original position."
1,"Since I put the encryption option on backups (in my case 1x a week) every time I connect to the Internet - several times a day - the app starts its ""while it completes, you can use your phone... ""but it doesn't. It slows down/blocks the internet and it takes an insane amount of time to browse a site, or even send a WhatsApp message! I'm gradually switching to Signal! I'm fed up with this GAFAM monopoly!"
1,"Two backups lost now! When my phone crashed last year, i could not get the backup to restore to the repaired phone. That was bad enough. Now when I tried to transfer my backup to a new phone, I couldnt find my encryption key, and once you start the transfer, there's no turning back, even though there was supposed to be a backup on Google Drive."
1,"The emoji menu of this new version is horrible. It often glitches and I can't see my message or if I already selected the emoji I wanted. The send button also dissapears from time to time with no apparent reason so I have to exit the menu and minimize my keyboard so I can then hit send. I also don't like the layout is now inverted to how it was before. It it ain't broke, don't fix it."
2,"It used to be a best app, user friendly and easy to see things whether it is about status or chats. Status came vertically however, Now it is coming like insta stories I don't like this thing in whatsapp. And It is repeatedly showing the channels spread below, Looking messy to me, I don't like it as well. Unfollowed channels should be hide, if one needs to check different channels to follow they can press any arrow key or else to see all channels so channels doesn't spread below."
1,The new sticker interface is horrible. This is terrible accessibility. The buttons on the bottom are too small and you guys changed the motion needed to swipe through the stickers. Changing places of buttons and which motions are needed is generally a bad move UNLESS they were actually in a counterintuitive position. Don't fix it if it ain't broken.
3,"Help. For more than a year I been having trouble with the backup messages. have it programmed for every day backup but it's never do it, always showing there was a kind of trouble try later or saying I should connect to WiFi when is connected. I ask a few people of they have the same issue and they said yes, always fighting with the backup because he do it when he want. Can you please help with this matter? I try everything and every WiFi connection, including my network phone but nothing work"
1,"this app keeps going backwards with these updates on android. the interface of the emoji panel is just confusing and unpractical. when i want to reply to a singular message and I swipe right, the keyboard doesn't automatically pop up anymore, and that's very annoying. even the homepage interface is trash, it's just a copycat from the ios version. i hope you'll eventually wake up and listen to your users one day. this used to be a great app, now I'm just disappointed."
4,"look guys, I like this app, it's world wide, easy and accessible, but van you please fix whatever problem you are having with the messages and their inability to go through, either via the quick message thing (notification bar - I think) and the in-app messaging. the app constantly doesn't send messages when the recipient and myself have extremely good wifi and Fibre. I like this app but this needs to be resolved. thanks Edit: thanks for the fix. I can finally vibe with WhatsApp again."
1,"absolutely HATE the new update!!! stickers and emoji keyboard has been moved ABOVE the keyboard which is stupid, it was way better at the bottom, and the stickers don't take you to your recently used stickers which is inconveniencing. each time you tap a sticker it updates all the stickers to make the one you just used at the top of the list, but the transition is so slow and not smooth like it was before. hate it. do better."
5,":) one of the most useful ""free"" applications available (despite it being a tool of surveillance). It is what Facebook should have been. A suggestion for improvement would be automatic translation (Airbnb has this feature inside the Airbnb message thread so good). Thank you WhatsApp for a good application that does not do continuous pay-as-you-go and advertising slamming. Useful around the world provided you have wifi. a peer to peer offline option would be cool"
1,"There must have been some call optimizations done during May/June. The calls since then have been horrible. Video consistently with an overlay blur, as it's trying to scale quality up or down. Really bad. Network speeds are 300mb up down. Latency and pings sub 10. It's only been recently. I noticed it since June. Maybe tail end of May. Needs to be addressed, video calls are pathetic at the moment."
4,"Great with the last update seeing missed calls in red, especially being able to edit after sending a message! However, I realise that the call log does not indicate the last call immediately after the call. It can be disheartening if you need to call the yet 'unknown' number back. It can even cause a business loss. It will be good if this can be addressed. Thank you."
3,The latest update has really ruined how everything used to operate before. I seriously would love if they stopped making unnecessary changes to everything - layout was just fine before there is no use of moving things around it just confuses people. The old emojis and gif system layout used to be just perfect and even the new status update is really annoying. Updates should make things easier and not more difficult to operate.
3,"it's a very good app and I love the new design, however for the past few days I've been getting daily backup errors telling me that I need to restore the messages. whenever the process is done, instead of the messages being restored they are deleted. I have chats that have lost up to three days of messages with this error, and the worst thing about it is that I have my backup set to daily."
1,"It was a great app until after the update. They have destroyed the whole name of ""privacy"" they have been building for Years. How can you forward a message. And it won't show that it was forwarded. The update have advantages and disadvantages but the advantages outweighs the disadvantages. For example if you forward a direct official message of public warning from an higher authority, it's appears like the information was forged by you because it does not show that it was forwarded"
3,"It's a great app. I use mostly this app to message people, but I seriously disliked the new update. The way they organized the stickers and how the text box gets displaced when you open the stickers section it was better when we could have our stickers separate by buttons not having to scroll for a solid minute while looking for the sticker I could've gotten quickly were it properly separated."
2,"The change to the emoji screens is driving me mad, once you use them the screen no longer scrolls up so you have to keep using the back button to see what you've written or emojis used. In my opinion this is not a positive change, so much so, I'm looking at other messaging apps. Shame really, as I've used this for years without any problems üòî"
5,"The home interface is very nice, but I think it would be more appealing if you can put an option to get rid of the tab names. The tab icons are pretty obvious and identifiable, especially for a long term user. It'll be much cleaner and minimal having that option."
3,"I have a problem with this app for a long time. It takes a lot of time to run,to upload even I have updated it , and is the latest version. Every time I open the app, problem persist, and even sometimes my data is lost, I can't receive messages at all. I would appreciate if you look forward to it"
1,"The new update that has introduced channels is the worst! What is wrong with you WhatsApp? Just leave the app be. We wanted an instant messaging platform, not another social media app. And there's no option to disable the channel thing either! I just don't want to see it. Now is high time to start searching for alternatives of WhatsApp & asking everyone in our contacts to switch."
1,"Effing desktop app updates! Why don't you guys fix your software! Downloading the app because the program has shut down because times up, then says Error in the Store, then says Uninstalled, then Error again and ""App cannot be updated when it's open"" but it's open because it's launching! Round and round we go. Happens every single time there's an update! You wouldn't have an app if it wasn't for us users. Get your act together!"
5,"I'm very happy for this new update, this new feature of sending HD images is something I have always been looking forward to. Now we can send full resolution images without them getting compressed. Thank you developers for adding this feature to our most beloved messaging platform."
1,"Hello, i think my account are error I can't receive any messages or calls but i still can send them and see my friend receive it. My connection is good and stable other apps works just fine, its only whatsapp. I tried to change number and finally i can receive the messages and calls but unfortunately its just temporary i stopped receive messages and calls after a couple minutes, i don't understand so i tried make new account on the same devices and it works just fine, please fix my old account."
4,"Very good messenger, but if some options add to this app, I'm sure to make this much better, editing text, choose video call regulation, choose photo quality before sending, and ... After 2 years, I got wat I wish: editing text, photo quality not as easy as I thought but even in setting is very good!"
5,Great app. Love the new HD feature on videos. Thats a GREAT feature üëè üëç. I used to struggle with resolution whenever i film my tutorials and post them in my whatsapp groups. The video would comeout blurry after posting it but now its crispy clearüòçüòç. The HD video option is not showing on my status though i don't know why
1,"The new modifiction on Whatsapp is not good at all, one who posts over 200 slides would have to run through a good number of slides before getting to a particular slide. Before one could delete a particular slide, one would have to go through series of slides which is tiring. I think the last feature of tapping on the three dots and immediately locating a particular slide should be brought back."
1,"Third class service, very poor. After I updated my new phone software, the watsapp status doesn't work and I was unable to download anything. So, I unstall it and again install it but the problem remains same. I don't know why this is happening? I am truely frustrated with the service. Even I searched in youtube regarding this problem, and I followed every step but still couldn't solve it. Very worse."
1,"The app used to be great until the new download. Now it has become extremely annoying. Incoming texts are hidden behind my text bubble... Emojis are no longer user friendly. If I made a mess like this at my job, I wouldn't have one anymore, so whomever is responsible for these changes needs to be replaced. You don't fix what isn't broken. There was absolutely no need for any of these changes to have been made. I would change to five star if you return the screen to pre update."
3,"WhatsApp audios are not being played when I press the play button, so I have to close the app and open it again. The keyboard also dissappear when I am typing (only with WhatsApp). When I finish recording audios, it takes like five seconds to send them üòû I use a Redmi Note 11 Lite(MIUI 14) - 6GB of RAM, only 52GB of storage is consumed of 128 GB. After two previous updates, WhatsApp has been presenting this issues. Please fix it. Four friends have also told me the same thing."
1,With every single update it just gets worse. Now the emoji panel goes up almost to the center of the screen and in big screens you have to make a unnatural movement to send the messages. Not to mention the glitch that makes me close the keyboard in order to be able to add an emoji. Otherwise it will shut the emoji panel down and prevent you from adding any.
2,"Please return the status updates to the way it was. Instead add an option to view channels or better still, create a different nav that would navigate to channels. The whole essence of WhatsApp is status from friends. This new update is defeating that purpose cos I don't see why I have to scroll and scroll to view updates from my friends. Infact, I can't even see the preview of their updates. I can only see their profile pic as preview. That's bad user experience please"
3,"After the last update, the list of participants is opening frequently without any interaction neither typing the @ to tag someone in a message. The sticker gallery is slow, before it was more fluid. I would appreciate if you include the option ""pin to top"" for important messages in chats."
2,"After a recent update, when I view my own video status, a 30 seconds video only plays about 10 seconds even though I have confirmed that others can see the full 30 seconds. I cleared cache, didn't help. Then I reset the whole phone and restored my messages, same story. What went wrong?"
1,"Why are the archived chats pinned at the top? If we are archiving someone that means we don't want to be constantly reminded that they have messaged, instead by pinning it at the top whatsapp is doing exactly that. This defeats the very purpose of archiving messages. Hope to see the option of pinning archived chats at the bottom in next update. Till then 1 star."
2,"The app is really good and easy to navigate through with a few hidden fixtures on it,but with the new update i really like the picture quality upgrades but it lacks those qualities when uploading your picture or video's on your status, it shows them abit blurry and always frustratesüò§ me out when trying to upload a good picture or video........."
3,"Why can't I send audio!? Also like the ""status updates"" what's happening there is this just slowy turning into some sort of social media app or sm and regarding statuses why are the videos I put up so low resolution. And just to add because why not why can I only put up a 30 second video on my status I feel like the length should be higher like 2 minutes maybe. But good app all together for the most part I guess"
2,"I don't like this latest update, I have no problem in the inclusion of channels, but why is there an omission to search in status options, whereas there are two options of uploading video or photos, the upper one should be change to search to make it more easier, Thank you."
5,"There is a need to add new features in it, write when WhatsApp has many features but it is not safe, But yeah it's good, Edit: I am shocked to see such good and funny features of urs and I do the same, I am very happy to see those features, u did a great job When I downloaded Wtsp for a few months, I was not satisfied with its features. Gradually, a lot of features were made available to me, I was very happy with it. u can also check some other features of WhatsApp background wallppr‚ù§Ô∏è thanks"
3,"The fingerprint lock is convenient but it is not complete , there should be an option to type pin or password if incase fingerprints are not working or we can't use our registered finger . Please add an alternate option if fingerprint lock is cancelled or not working . Hope there's an update for this issue ASAP . Its been so long you guys haven't rectufied it ."
4,"Love the delete a message for everyone up to an hour later feature, but since you can do that, can you not also make it so that you can edit a message, even if it's only up to an hour after? Autocorrect doesn't always work with me üòù WhatsApp is great in my apt where I have zero signal, but can use wifi like a boss üëç Update: I can now edit messages! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Now if only data could be stored on an external SD card, this app would be deserving of 5 stars..."
1,The new update is difficult to navigate especially when you have posted a lot on your status and you'd like to select a few to delete. You'd have to delete it one after the other which is so stressful. You cannot also get a search button to quickly type and select the status you wish to watch you have to go through your contact status which is quite a long list to get to the preferred status you want to watch
2,Fix issues with the media quality. Option to choose media upload quality is no longer available causing pictures and videos on statuses to be very low quality. Give us the option to choose the quality we want otherwise it makes no sense and we would have to find other means of sharing experiences outside of this app.
1,"I noticed a bug in WhatsApp Story. If you watch 2 video in one story, the 2nd video duration just simply the same as 1st video. Let me explain, let's say there are 2 videos, (20s and 30s) in one story. But the order is the shortest (20s) video first, and this will make the 2nd video (30s) stop playing right at 20s as the 1st video. This bug kinda annoying, and I hope it'll fixed soon"
1,1.I did not like the recent feature release where when I'm replying to a message (via sliding the person's message) and my keyboard doesn't pops up. I have to click again so that the keyboard pops up. Why I have to do 2 steps where as earlier I could do the same in 1 step. 2.The emoji board is now occupying half of my screen(bad) where earlier it used to occupy less than half(good).Its becoming an inconvenience while reading the chat as the emoji box opens up and allowing me less content to read
1,"I'm not happy with the channels addition to the update. You're not even given an option to deactivate or remove them, which really makes for an uncomfortable and overall terrible experience. I'm not hopeful because the annoying Facebook sharing feature still lives on, but I wish whatsapp would remove this new feature or at least make it possible to remove or deactivate it if you don't want it."
5,"Please add a feature whereby you can remove a person from the group by just clicking on their phone number or name after they sent a message. It is hard having to look for the person in a group of 300 people just to remove them. Thank you, I trust you ""Meta Team"". We also need ""View once status""."
2,New update sucks. Edit function is good but the sticker layout makes it so troublesome to send stickers. When you want to use multiple stickers and it keeps scrolling to the top recent each time you press on one. And the scrolling is not convenient as previously when it goes by page.
5,I really like the new features of WhatsApp. I am giving my opinion. It would be nice to have a new update where we can adjust the time in the last seen to our liking and also see the last seen of the people in the contact list. Similarly changing WhatsApp status to 60 seconds or 2 minute is something that everyone wants.
4,"The only thing i hate is the photo/video quality reduction üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠..... i should be free to share and view original high quality images because data comsumption isnt a problem. Those who wanna save data can edit that in their own settings by themselves. Quality reduction should be an option not mandatory üòî. Last thing, i can no longer copy unsent statuses and messages whilst still typing. Fix that to the original way"
3,"Would be nice to be able to create & organize our own separate & personal folders, for our contacts along with special & important videos or texts, or messages. Would be nice to be able to forward video clips, editorials or whatever content to my own email & cell, & others outside the WhatsApp circle and/or to individual emails! A visual ""How To Use WhatsApp"" would be nice. Not everyone has the time to be a cell-phone Nerd !!!"
4,"I usually skip the ratings and reviews because I don't always feel like setting time out to do them. However, the recent update of this app made me MAKE time to write this review.. I don't like the status tab outline.. Please please, take it back to how it was before.. Instead, what you could try to do is place the channels on the top instead of where they are and set the statuses the way they were.. Also, the search icon you removed from the status tab, please, PUT IT BACK.. Thank you..üôÇ"
5,"I have one suggestion that'll make it more effective one thing as compared to other applications. When we want to send picture or video to anyone, we first have to select that required thing and then we preview it. After that, again we have to go back and select other things to preview it before sending it. Similarly when we want to update status, first we select than preview. If we want more things, we have to go again to select. I suggest there must be scroll without going back to gallery."
1,I would have given zero stars if possible. I can't record audios... The app crashes and my phone restarts everytime I try to record an audio message. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still hasn't changed. I even tried whatsapp business. The audio recording is working fine on all other apps. My phone is Moto g62 5g. I will rate 5 stars after correcting the issue.
4,"After update, there's no option to search for status if you want to quickly access a specific individual status. Kindly check on that. Secondly, the option that used to be there ""Media upload quality"", I can't seem to find it anymore. Make these two features available please"
1,"The latest version is the worst, l can't even post pictures or videos on my status without the quality being ruined and making it worse. They need to bring back the old version and it was better. Some group chats l can't even hide them, my voice notes? Can't even talk about them because at first l thought that it was my phone but no it was the app!"
3,"We appreciate the effort that went into the new update but there are some issues. My WhatsApp notifications don't come through if the app is closed and I'm unable to turn on ""pop-up notifications"". Please update or revert back to previous version. Also preferred the emojis on the bottom row."
3,"The channel that is recently introduced doesn't give space for searching statuses, and I suggest there should be a tab for status and another one for channel, so that we can navigate through statuses easily. Imagine I have to scroll back more than 200 statuses before getting back to my own that I want to delete, it's tiring. Please work on it in the next update"
1,The new updated version isn't user-friendly on status's. With the older version you could see how many people have seen your status immediately on the right side. You could delete a couple at a time and now all that is gone. You must go through all your statuses to the end to see who have seen it and can only delete it one by one while it's open.
2,"The new emoji tray is TERRIBLE. At least let us choose to use the old one if we want to. Also the voice notes and calls are still so finicky when you move your phone. Between pausing and switching the audio output by itself, nobody asked for that."
1,"This app is 10 years behind the competition (like Telegram). Embarrassing lack of innovation and frustrating to use. Attaching pictures, for example, is ridiculously cumbersome vs other apps. They only just recently introduced editing! Sad to think what we'd have if Facebook/Zuck didn't acquire it."
2,"I was an OG WhatsApp user. I paid for it when it first came out and have seen all the changes that were made. For messaging, it's still great for messaging but all these updates are sending it down hill. Facebook/Meta ruins everything it touches. Why can't WhatsApp stay as a simple messaging platform. First they add channels, then probably short videos or reels like Instagram, then ads. Download Signal."
1,"Wouldn't have updated it if it were not because of a force update. Not sure why new UI was introduced for emoji. Also the new updates have lots of bugs, messages wouldn't auto scroll when you typed in a new message, and sometimes the send button disappear and the camera and attachment button merged into one."
1,"The new update that changes the status updates is so terrible. You don't get to see the time somebody uploads a status without viewing it. And the search Option has been removed too from the status area. It's so annoying that you have to go through all your status before you can delete. Let's say you want to delete like 10 status updates, you'll have to go through all to delete the ones you want to delete"
1,"When I'm searching for a gif, can no longer scroll down through results. Instead the gif tab resets back to the default page that you get when you open the gif tab. The gif feature is effectively useless now. So sick of big corporations ruining perfectly good features on perfectly good apps. Why do you have to go and break what wasn't broken guys?"
1,"How many years? How many years does it take to fix a simple conversion problem? ""Can't send this video. Choose a different video and try again."" Why the heck should a user have multiple apps to convert a video and a separate app to send it? Telegram doesn't have such issue, Whatsapp has it for the whole it's life. UPD: and after the last update stickers are broken again. For hell's sake give me the source code and I will fix this peace of garbage by myself."
3,"The last few updates have added some really unnecessary changes, please no one uses communities or Follow channels. Add back the abilities to search contacts in status and stop trying to force us to share to Facebook... we all saw the feature added but now it feels like it's been rubbed more in our faces. Only update we really want in sharing media on status at a higher quality."
1,"Pathetic new update. Status tab is replaced by updates tab which doesn't have search option for contact status and also it shows the DP picture in thumbnail while earlier status tab was showing what contacts have kept on their status. There are channels added which you can follow, but it is dominating user friendly access to the status view."
1,Status videos are not visible. While I am sending the a video in my status the pixels were not clear. I tried it few times but no use. Its an amazing app but this kind of errors make me upset. And also the new update is very bad I don't like it. I think in status also you can implement HD option It may reduce the problem.
1,"What is the point of a local backup that it does every day when it will instantly delete everything once uninstalled. Absolutely ridiculous. Lost all my photos as well. So stupid. Now i reinstalled with no backup to restore from and no media. Beautifully idiotic. Why did it delete all media from my phone? Images and videos should not have been deleted like that. Here's my suggestion, just delete all voice notes and what not when uninstalled but let me keep the damn images. Jeez."
1,"Been using whats app since it's birth. Amazing application. For those individuals who don't use social media, whats app was the app to keep in touch with your personal contacts only and keep away from unnecessary distractions. The current update, which introduces 'channels' is very annoying and no option for it be removed. Unfortunately people like me will unninstall the app unless whats app brings an option to remove channels completely and not show it any where under your status update."
3,"After last update, I wanted to send 43 photos in HD. Selected everything in a single go and while sending only around 30 photos was sent, remaining was still loading and it can't be sent. If you have such limitations why can't you say that while selecting the photos."
2,"The update made it so that whenever you are on a call and go on loud speaker to get something from an app that's not WhatsApp, the mic stops working. I don't know if it just is a me problem, but it just cuts the mic off when on loud speaker outside the app. Hopefully this gets resolved soon -Galaxy S10+"
1,After update Status issue ( thisa media is not available in your internal storage) I have done everything there is a seperate folder irrespective Android inside media folder which is com.whatsapp which is empty and and there is no Status folder in my file manager. This I have benn facing since last update please fix this issue. ESPECIALLY IN MY Android 10.
3,"Newest update, while on a call, you can not turn on Bluetooth. You have to end the call and recall the person to use Bluetooth. One review by Collin104 said it best, "" The app tries to improve, but takes a step backwards with each update."""
4,"Please provide a toggle button to switch off whatsapp like an airplane mode in android, it will promote healthier digital use. Every time someone sends a message, they expect you to reply or respond immediately and with so many people on your contact list the number of messages can be overwhelming sometimes. With an on off toggle we can access whatsapp whenever we want and plan to respond to messages at our convenience. The other person would clearly understand if the app. is off for some time."
3,"This new interface is not at all as friendly as the previous version and I'm even scared to update any further. The search icon for status is gone and you can't view a list of your status post no more. These features are very important to users llike me and wish they would be restored, please. Thank you for this great platform and the love it promotes amongst us and for your anticipated positive response."
3,Overall this app is great in every aspect I like it very much but previously some updated features are not good such as story update on overall contact in chat with green circle is the wrost way . If we want to ignore someones story but the circle remains there and second one when you open dp the status showa up. This is not acceptable at all. Keep it simple no need for updares and other trash like material. Remove the option from status and updatess
1,The status we upload either photo or video the file is compressed and the quality of the file is lost totally. Please update this. Yeah so I had posted this long back great none of the developers are interested heh. Yeah at least let there be a option to logout. I really don't want the app on always so please get this app a Logout option.
1,"After the latest update the app became very buggy while texting!! the emoji Button disappears, and when sending the message, there is a white space on the screen. also the way the emojis are listed now is incredibly confusing after being used to swiping horizontally for years. please make this optional"
1,This update should be called a downgrade...I post videos on my status it only shortens them and the keyboard and stickers are just not it the old version was better I might as well switch to something better cause this is so frustrating...I mean what was the purpose of upgrading the app when it only makes things worse fix the issues we're having or switch back to the old version once All the things you did with WhatsApp are really unnecessary
1,"Stop fixing what's not broken! It was working fine a few years back. Whatsapp web now is terrible, the webapp even worse, the new stickers position is horrible, auto-scrolling somewhere else when sending stickers is terrible and dangerous, specially when wanting to send multiple stickers quickly. Sticker management was bad and now it's surprisingly worse"
4,Its really very good app. But there is slight issue here as short circle video is not working in the app only voice recording is working. I am not able to switch into short video even after clicking on voice recording option. Please look into it.
2,"Idk but please fix this bug 1. When i send sticker to personal chat, it'll also being sent to group chat randomly 2. Sound delay in statuses 3. Sticker pack missing suddenly after not being use for a long time 4. Some statuses video can't be played I'm enjoying using this app, but I'll give rating higher after the issue being fix"
3,"It was great until this new update. No more sending video notes. The horizontal orientation of statuses is not cool at all. Worse still, as I slide through people's statuses, my status 'icon' moves away. It sucks. Also, the channels stuff is no so cool if I can't create my own channel. I don't know the reason behind it though"
5,"I love the update plus an addition of channels below status but please return the search bar (search button) for status (updates). We can't scroll all the way one by one looking for specific status you want to review especially when one has lot's of contacts who are active on whatsapp. Also arrangement of sticker, emoji and GIF part..its cool but slows us down. Also please VIEW ONCE feature doesn't work on people who are using GB WHATSAPP kind of app. Otherwise you're the best!‚úäüèΩ"
1,"ALL MY CHAT MEDIA WAS LOST DURING TRANSFER i chose the transfer chats feature to transfer whatsapp to my new phone and I had backed up everything before doing so but it said at 40% that ""some error has occurred"" and then the WhatsApp opened in the new phone without any media at all. And all the media started disappearing from the previous phone. It was important personal data. Now there's no way to recover it. Even the whatsapp storage is in KBS now instead of GBs"
4,"Everything is great! Except one thing. So before this update, I could edit my statuses, but now I can't. So if I wanted to delete anything or skip to anything, I could, but not I can't. And I like the following update, but please add the status editing back because this can be annoying at times."
3,"Dear WhatsApp, the new update is cool, but dismantling the status section is very inconvenient. The old status triple dot option was really helpful. Removing it is awful. Also with the channels option, knowing the time a status came in is also difficult same thing with removing the thumbnail. And the status search botton has been removed and replaced with another camera icon is also very unpleasant. Please fix these things, thank you."
5,Using what's app from a long time but now due to channels feature I already started looking out for another messaging app. Everyone is introducing channels connection. We move to what's app just to avoid spamming and other sorts of video and all. But now what's is doing same thing. If you do not to take it back then you have to face the consequences.
1,"This pass few days, the app had always kept reminding me about starting a community (whatever that is). The most annoying thing is that, the reminder always show up everytime I open the app no matter how many time I close the reminder. It's annoying and should not be there. Would give this app a 0 star."
1,"Last update was on Sep 13/15 and yet they didn't fix the issue where swiping to the right on a message will pop the keyboard up for you to text your reply. This is the most annoying problem ever since the last updates. After every update, they change ""issues"" no one noticed, and ignore the problems everyone is complaining about. Also, the customer service is not top tier, I was given the same answer multiple times."
4,"Even though I have enabled high-priority notifications, am not getting previews on the home screen... I tried all the settings on my phone too... Am unable to fix this issue for the past 3 days... This happened after I went to start the checkup link which they showed in the privacy but I was unable to reset now... Someone Give me suggestions plss.."
1,There are no the three dots to take you to each status. This version forces you to see you status right from the first one to the last. We need the dots so that we can choose what to do with our already updated status. One may have updated 30 statuses and he/she wants to see the views on the 17th status. This new version can't allow you do that. You just have to start from the first one until you reach the one you want. Terrible
2,"Since the most recent update, whenever i try to listen to a voice message, the proximity sensor activates, the screen goes off and it plays through the top speaker only. Update, it isn't the proximity sensor at all because i just turned it off and it's dojng the same thing"
1,Please consider leaving the captions when forwarding one's status to another...and also the three dots that's found by the side of one's status updates...lots of important options that were found there are now absent...and let's also be able to share our status on other social media platforms once more...thank you...the search button in the status page is also important ... Whatsapp got difficult.
1,Worst ever updated what's up. Worst ever. Status not play for 30 seconds. At the time of uploading show 30 seconds but after upload its run for 15 seconds only. I relly tired to set my video on status ( 30 seconds) but its run half so song play very badly short n lyrics missing. I thinking abt uninstall this what's up.
5,"l love the variety of features like voice messages, video calls, and the ability to share photos and documents. The recent addition of disappearing messages adds an extra layer of privacy. The app's constant updates show that the developers are committed to improving the user experience."
1,"We don't want these new channels updates ...whatsapp is a messaging and status viewing app, it should stay that way...we will keep up with the other things on actual social media... Thank you. Also, the new feature where you can share your screen on a video call is really cool."
4,This update has got a very weird glitch. I m uploading a video that is longer than 30 seconds. But I trimmer it to 27 seconds while editing it in my status. But the status is uploaded to only 10 seconds. I mean what the heck. Please fix it man!!!!üôÉüò§
1,"The app attempts to improve but goes with each update. I have the Galaxy S22 + and the popup notifications are no longer available for my version of android. Yea, because not being able to receive notifications when I receive a message on a messaging app is super ""helpful""."
4,"I would've given it a five star rating as it is one of the best messaging app I've ever used. But there is a problem now with the new update. It's in the status. When I put status, it is not put as I wanted to. Sometimes its shorter than I've put while sometimes it doesn't even tell you how long your status is. Kindly fix this problem."
3,"The app is actually a good one but the latest updates just keeps closing it's not opening on my phone anytime I open it, it is always saying whatsapp isn't working I have to close it and open it again same thing I don't know if I lost all my chats and everything on WhatsApp? Please fix this it's frustrating getting notifications but not able to open them and actually respond to my messages. I'm giving a three-star review because there was a time the app was okay but then the update started."
1,"Since WhatsApp was updated in August, the app now crashes within 1 second every time I try to use it. I've tried everything - uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone, putting it in deep sleep and clearing the cache but nothing works. The customer service is truly awful. They take up to 24 hours to reply and when they do they haven't even tried to read my message and reply with nonsense that has nothing to do with my issue. This is my first 1 star review."
2,"I've been using WhatsApp for a long time, and it's been amazing, but the passed few updates have been an annoyance. The emoji panel has been rearranged and the channels in the status panel is irritating, there should at least be a setting to hide them from the panel for those of us who don't want it"
1,"Just make the interface like before. And the status too, the sharing option. We used to be able to choose which status to delete. Updates have not prove to be successful. Seriously we dont need the channels."
1,Are you serious with the UI problem that we dont expect a popular messenger app to have? When you dont even have such problem before the update? Can you check expand and collapse the keyboard but then you leave a blank space there and dont even bother to push up my message? Interface to choose emoji is so awful and super not user-friendly! What a failure update!!
1,"Now, It is no longer messaging app. It is now turning to social media app like insta, facebook, etc. I can't able to upload video on my status, I tried with other phones and accounts but it doesn't work. Now it's time to switch to other messaging app like telegram or signal."
1,"The recent update of emojis ,stickers, gifs is totally frustrating and irritating. The panels have come upside down and the backspace button has gone up , searchbar has come up ..it's really annoying to adapt to so many things at once! Very difficult to adapt!!!!"
1,"This is the first time that I rate an application with one star, and I know that the application deserves more than that, because of the support available through the application that did not solve a problem that I faced with the application.When I text them, they reply to me as if I am a stupid person or that he is the one who talks to a robot and answers according to the keywords. This is annoying, there is a problem and support does not even provide an appropriate or correct answerÿå thanks WA"
5,"I have nothing to criticise about whatsapp messenger. my only challenge of recent was after the update, it came with these features"" Channels or Find channels"" which I feel shouldn't be visible on my wall. I rather prefer it to be somewhere you can always use it if one wish not it appearing on my wall constant. Also the status has been changed to update. as much as we appreciate the update, I don't like some of the new features it came with."
1,"I really don't like the new update where the channels are covering the muted statuses. I am not interested in following random people I do not know at all, I am only interested in following Jesus. What I also don't like is the fact that we didn't even get to choose if we want the channels option or not. It was just thrown in our face. I want the channels option to move out of my muted statuses space!"
1,"Since the recent update, the images/Videos are being lost from my phone and the profile picture disappears. The sizes of messages and attachments changes, and it hangs. Contacts does not appear on the screen. Please fix the problems,"
1,"I regret to say that the recent updates to WhatsApp have left me thoroughly disappointed. This once-beloved app has taken a turn for the worse, and here's why: . **Unwanted Features:** New features like Stories and disappearing messages seem forced and don't add significant value to the app. They only serve to complicate what used to be a straightforward messenger. In summary, the latest version of WhatsApp has lost its charm. It's no longer the simple, efficient messaging app"
1,The latest updates are terrible. You can not forward a message without waiting hours for options to come up. You keep trying to force the Windows app on us instead of web whatsqpp. What is going on? Web and phone don't sync. Messages are lost. It's a joke.
4,Hello WhatsApp team. I have a feeddback for you people. If I go to Settings > Data & Storage > Media auto Download . I get control of it on different network connections. Problem: But it applieson all individual or groups contact. Solution: This setting should be be there on contact level. Either group or individuals. In this way we can have more specific control on auto download of files. If I want to disable it for a particular group or individual only. Thanks.
3,"Hello, in the latest version I cannot access my custom sticker packs, only the recently used and the favorites (and downloaded one if that matters). All the icona are present in the bar at the bottom, but if I tap one, it does nothing, if I scroll I don't see them, but only what mentioned above."
1,"WhatsApp used to be so good back in the days and now its in a horrible condition in spite of having millions of users.....the latest update broke it.....now i cannot send voice messages, cannot see the storage each chat is consuming. Whenever i want to use these features it crashes. And its now dangerously close to being completely unusable."
3,"The new sticker interface is absolutely terrible. Its so time consuming for the whole thing to scroll up and down, and it feels so counter-intuitive. Good job breaking something which needed no fixing at all."
4,It is a great app... One thing i hope can be done.... Let the archived converstions be at the end of the conversation list not at top.... It is archived because we do not want to see them jumping to the top of the list... Now it is always to the top weather there r new messages or not... That is not smart at all.
5,"WhatsApp Messenger is a reliable and widely used messaging app that offers a seamless communication experience. Its end-to-end encryption ensures privacy, and features like voice and video calls, group chats, and file sharing make it versatile. However, it can be data-intensive, and some may have concerns about its privacy policies. Overall, it's a dependable choice for staying connected with friends and family."
1,"Recent update of merging emojis, gifs, avatars and stickers sucks a lot! Moreover moving the backspace to the top in the emoji menu is giving me frustration as each and every time my finger goes to old position which is now flag emoji space ü´† Finally, on clicking search option in emoji section, the cursor still remains in the chat, we have to again click in search window. If I click search icon, it clearly means that I need to search for an emoji, but why the cursor is still in the chat!?‚ÄΩ"
2,"Since the mid septembre update I'm facing numerous bugs in the app. The screen freezes when you send a text, the whole text deletes when you touch it when typing, when scrolling up discussions you find yourself in a random date though the chat and also PLEASE put back the sticker, emoji and Gif box it is was before PLEASE even the delete button has been displaced though before the use was much more fluent."
1,"I think channels and statuses should be on separate tabs because they get in the way of each other. Now I can't mass delete my statuses, I have to go to them one by one to delete them, its impossible to select statuses to share to Facebook after updating a status. All this because you wanted to add stupid channels"
5,"The best app I have ever come across in comunication. Truly, this app is accepted for the replacement of letterwriting and posting, it saves time and inconviniences.It must be admire by all and sundry. Thanks to those who dreamed and created this app.It has really fulfilled the scriptures that "" knowledge will increase in the last days. Its also easy to learn, and enables quick communications. Knowledge indeed, is power."
1,"WhatsApp is a versatile messaging app, but it's frustrating that I can't send videos to my friends. This limitation hampers the overall experience, especially when sharing memorable moments or important content. It's a feature I hope WhatsApp addresses in future updates."
1,"When switching from my current Android device to a new one, I find the WhatsApp backup process to be quite cumbersome. Unlike Telegram, where chat data is securely stored in the cloud and readily available on any device, WhatsApp's chat and media backup feature could be more user-friendly. It would be great if WhatsApp could implement a similar seamless backup and restore system"
2,I updated the app and now it is showing me an Update pane which is combination of Status and add channel both. I hate this feature. Simplest is the best. Earlier it was just STATUS tab. That was perfect. But why we have this Update tab now. Either remove it or optional it. But don't fixed it.
2,"Please, the latest update is horrific! Emoji keyboard is just awful now! Why do devs just move around things at random, it's so disruptive, I can't find anything any more.. swiping now does completely different things!! Its like swapping the pedals on a car.. it was so much better with gif options below! And let me at least disable or remove the ""channels"" or the obnoxious suggestions, I couldn't care less about footie teams or Mark effing Zuck.."
1,"The voice is getting paused even though the video is running. I'm not able to hear full sentences. Even tried to reinstall fresh app, which seems like something is going on at the back end during call with my number only."
5,WhatsApp has been getting a lot better within these few years since what it was. It would be great if it had the option in the settings to turn off the status feature or at least block it from the Application's UI. It can be somewhat distracting from general messaging.
1,I hate the constant changes in whstapp. It is up to me if I want to update it or not. When I access the emojis. I have to step back to access keyboard. Its all a total mess. I love the old version of it. Not this updated one. I just hate using keyboard now as I am used to the previous one.
1,"I don't know why, but my backup got a password of its own that I never set up or had to use in the future. I understand the privacy and safety concerns, but to a limit; not being able to freely access my important chats because of it, is a big issue."
1,"The new Channel is unnecessary - we have a group feature already. It is much better if an app has specific known features, not bring every feature into a single app. The search feature in status should be brought back, same as the the list of personal status."
3,"I'm currently on satisfied with the update in Status Section (Channels). I can't easily give my status or rather delete it. I have to find a lot to get the Status Privacy. Those things were right near our fingers when we used to give our Status, thus it creating a bit problem. Else rest of the things are just fabulous. Thank you."
1,"I was very disappointed with WhatsApp. The call quality is unacceptably poor, with frequent dropouts and unintelligible sounds. In terms of functionality, I feel that this app fails on all levels. The constant updates only make it more difficult to use.What concerns me most, however, is the lack of privacy protection. I feel like my personal data is constantly being compromised. This is not what I would expect from communication.Overall, WhatsApp is a huge waste of time and privacy for me."
1,"first of all, the new layouts and updates are so annoying and makes my whole phone lag. i cant even send stickers without the bar going laggy and then my application crashing. what im furious about is the 'updates' part, there used to be a slide where i can see all my posted statuses and how many views there are but now it doesn't even exists; as someone who always post statuses and delete it i find it very annoying. the new layouts are ugly and useless, what even are channels?!"
4,"This app is like a default messenger. It's amazing and a key for mobiles. But there is a problem that we can't load any file such as video probably not more than I think 64 MB. So, it becomes difficult. So please look into it to kindly increase the limit as short videos cost much MBs. Rest is amazing. Features and new Emojis are good. Pls also add an option for commenting in channels. If we will be able to comment in channels, WhatsApp will be the best!"
1,"Whatsapp video call and normal call has been experiencing very bad problems, like sudden disconnection, multiple reconnectings even though internet connection was good, this issue has been surfacing lately and i really need whatsapp to fix into this problem... It wasnt like this in the past.. please fix! Actually getting worst for the call and vidcall... kept on disconnecting with no reason, even though connection is very stable"
5,"Near perfect chatting app that seldom fails, whether you're video calling or simply texting, it offers you absolute satisfaction. The only drawback was that messages could not be edited after posting them, but in the new updated app, any messages posted can be edited within fifteen minutes after they are posted, good job WhatsApp."
4,"So far, it is the best experience amongst all the messaging apps but facing one problem, which is very annoying most of the time. When I'm using WhatsApp on a linked device(mobile), the contacta saved on the linked device doesn't function (not use able) . Whatsapp, please consider my application."
4,"This is absolutely perfect and all the people who have a phone must be downloading this app, but there is one drawback in it, which has just come in a new updated version, that you cannot place your on your private chart. Instead of finger lock, you should also keep pin lock or pattern lock."
1,Recent update is worst which includes Channeling and made some changes in story location from vertical to horizontal. And we're also unable to see the time of uploading of someone's story and how many stories have been uploaded by someone until we open the story. Please replace it with the old one.‚òπÔ∏èüò†
1,"Don't like the latest update. The status tab has been changed to updates, and you can no longer search for a specific contact to view their status. Please bring back the search feature. This is time-consuming, having to scroll through all contacts to see the status you are looking for üòë."
1,"The newest update SUCKS! Somebody please fix it, I'm not asking... I'm begging! The new emoji layout is terrible! Also... you used to swipe left to take a photo?? which was very convenient, now it's just random! The app has been glitching non-stop since the update! Everyone I know is complaining about it! No one is happy! Horrible update!"
2,"Please give us the basic privacy-respecting feature of hiding when we're typing. Credit where due, you added the ability to hide when you're online. If you allow us to hide typing too then I will happily consider using WhatsApp in addition to Signal which is excellent when it comes to privacy, security and features. EDIT: Also please add an option to schedule a message to be sent at a particular time. It's incredibly useful and I don't know why it's still missing when even SMS and email have it!"
2,"Now-a-days if whatsapp is holding multiple features but in WhatsApp group more updates required, like in disappearing messages if one person disappear messages after 24hrs, other person may expect disappear after 90 days. If it comes individual to everyone, it will be very great. It won't consume other's space storage the person who wants to disappearing every 24hours."
5,"Dear WhatsApp developer team üòä, Please remove the ""read receipt"" feature, I know I am the only person who is against it, but many people have a big problem with this feature, but they are not talking about it. Some people turn off the read receipt feature and see all the massages and status but what about those people who are waiting for their massages? You can use this feature in ""WhatsApp Premium or Subscription"" Think about it ? üí¨ And Thanks for your all services and features üòä"
3,"Is anyone else experiencing a bug with WhatsApp? For a few months now, the ""‚úîÔ∏è"" remains grey, they no longer turn blue when someone has read my message. It's a tiny bit frustrating as i can no longer tell if my messages have been read by people, forcing me to have to call them to be sure.... I want to mention that the app is updated to the latest version and i've also tried uninstalling & installing it again, with no results."
4,"The latest update of WhatsApp introduced superfluous functionalities, particularly the inclusion of HD video and photo sharing capabilities. While these additions are commendable, it would be greatly appreciated if the update also incorporated the ability to post high-definition status updates of extended duration. Additionally, it is imperative that users be given the capacity to insert line breaks in the status text box. We kindly request these essential enhancements."
5,"LOVE IT! I can chat with anyone at any time for free. I can send files, videos and photos there's a poll option and you can post daily updates on your status! But for Christ's sake bring back the normal status!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate having random famous people's status... please get rid of it!!! Other than that it's amazing! And has features where you can mute or private chats so you don't get disturbed by messages and has features so you can turn off unwanted pics/vids from entering your gallery."
2,"The app was pretty good, stable and everything, but the call history seems a bit unstable and the new menu after this update is really horrible, it makes it really hard for me to navigate emojis, gifs, and stickers, please fix it or turn it to the old version again, thanks."
4,"Currently, vidoe quality in puting status is far reduced then perviously, so there is gap to increase the quality level of videos puting into statuses. Except this quality gap, everything is perfact and amazing. Yes, quality of photos convert onto HD print features is one be best feature, so keep it up. You guys are performing excellent üëçüèª"
1,"The latest update of WhatsApp is terrible and It is definitely not good for the user experience. ‚òπÔ∏è Introducing channels, new interface of status updates, handiling of stickers give a really bad user experience. Many of users love the previous update of WhatsApp and it is really easy to operate. Truly, I'm getting tired of using WhatsApp and I don't feel like I couldn't use the app as it is now. It has many steps to proceed with a single action now. Kindly revert it to a previous update please."
4,"WhatsApp works perfectly fine, except that most of my conversations' messages don't tell me when it's read, like the 2 ticks doesn't glow blue for read messages, and I can't see most of the contacts' last online time, overall a great app but please fix this issue."
4,"I'd like to make a quick recommendation. The newly added edit message is a good addition that many people have been waiting for, however it doesn't seem to be very user-friendly. If this feature had been available when we pressed and held the text, it would have been excellent. I hope there would be some changes in future releases ."
1,"HATE the new layout update especially the emoji and sticker layout. The status is annoying too because you have to actually go through your statuses to delete and and the channels layout is awfully ugly. What happened to WhatsApp??? New update, after seeing someone's update, i can't see it anymore. Idk if this a bug or what but it's annoying."
2,"I have been facing the issue with the green screen. If someone is video calling me so they can't see me(they only get a green screen), I can see them. I have tried almost everything, uninstalled the app, switched off the phone, etc. Nothing worked. Please let me know if someone faces the same issue or got the solution for this."
2,"It is not possible to archive communities anymore (annonsment groups). App keeps crashing all the time. Forward and sharing takes foreverever, like there is some infinite loop somewhere. maybe I've got a big db mybe I have many contacts, but I expect an app like this to be able to deal with that more successfully"
2,Notificatication should be sent or an alert is to be raised if messages are editied in chats .WhatsApp is hanging these days. Whenever I try to forward any message or any media it buffers. Moreover it takes long time to load messages whenever net is on ( compare to earlier )internet seed has not change . Other aps are working well only issue is with whatspp
2,"There was no use in bringing the channels concept. Or you should have created a separate page or app for channels. It has ruined the very concept of messaging. It was neat and clean in starting. Now with all these unnecessary add ons, it has become a COMPLETE MESS. thanks whatsapp developers team to ruining your own app and making our experience with your uncomfortable."
3,"The app is quite good, but I can't edit the name I used to save my contacts. Once I edit and tap on the save button, it goes back to the previous name. This is frustrating üò°. I hope u can make some changes."
2,"the new emoji keyboard is very annoying, it's way shorter than the keyboard so when I switch from keyboard to add an emoji it takes a second to load and the text bar is suddenly hovering at the top and part of the background pictures is visible and the emoji keyboard is down and only shows the first row of emojis and the top half of the second row's emojis bc of how short it is. we should also be given the option to choose the video and pictures quality in statuses"
2,This is a great app overall but I'm not in agreement with the new Channels features that recently came. I'd rather my WhatsApp be for my contacts list and that only I would appreciate if that channel feature can be optional so for some of us that don't want to see it we can deactivate it. I like WhatsApp as WhatsApp. If I wanted to follow a channel I have YouTube and everything else for that. To me it just doesn't serve it's purpose as an app any longer very diluted not cool.
5,"Title: Exceptional Help Center Support on WhatsApp Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5) WhatsApp's Help Center is truly outstanding in every aspect. I cannot express enough how impressed I am with the level of assistance and support provided by their team. Here are a few reasons why I'm giving it a perfect 5-star review: 1. **Swift Response Times**: Whenever I've encountered an issue or had a question, the Help Center's response time has been incredibly fast. I've received timely responses."
4,"the app is outclass,but kindly do the emoji's box as old, it is so disgusting. there should be an individual boxes or whatever you call that but there should an individual classes for every emoji, animals emojis ,fruits ,flages etc for better looking and for better experience. Thank you so very much."
3,"No more well suited for my blackberry KEYone, as the emojis part doesn't show up properly. There are also errors in forwarding messages and trimmed videos don't work anymore (they become slow fps and stop after a second). Had no proplems until a couple of months back."
2,I have successfully created WhatsApp poll and send to my one of friend. Now I wanted to forward that poll to another group because I do not want to type all option and spent time again. I do not see any option to forward poll . That's fine if I forward that poll without earlier vote. At least WhatsApp should provide an option to forward poll
2,"In order to listen to voice messages, you must have WhatsApp open with your screen on. So you can't listen to a long voice message while you do something else on your phone (and your phone can't go sleep either... the screen must be on). Very frustrating and a waste of energy. It was not like this before (great updatesüëåüèº)."
1,"I'm using WhatsApp since a long back but the recent update where ""UPDATES"" column is added and several channels created is the worst update as it gets. Atleast a messaging application should have been maintained for some specific tasks, now all applications these days are trying to become ""ALL IN ONE APP"" and that is highly disappointing. Seriously I haven't considered leaving WhatsApp till now but I'll have to switch to signal or other open source messaging application. Unnecessary Update."
1,"Since the last two updates, I've been having issues, I have tried everything to solve this situation, I contacted WhatsApp support and the replies have been ridiculous, most likely automatic and NOT HELPFUL AT ALL. They suggested things I already know, I've already tried, the issues are still there... Might have to stop using this app. They audios will not reproduce, no matter what."
1,It's incredible how you like to make things complicated and not supported. It's been hours trying to transfer data from an iPhone 6 to a new android phone and I solved nothing. I couldn't do the backup on Drive using the iPhone (only iCloud) and the option to transfer data to android it's totally messed up and not working. I tried to manually transfer the backup (databases+media) after making them ok for Android but not detected as backup. Everything it's made to be tricky.
4,It's very easy to use and is a good way to instantly connect with friends and family if you have WiFi or mobile data. Can add a feature to schedule send messages to my contacts? I like the idea of scheduled messages as it is convenient and useful if I want to schedule send something to them. Thank you.
1,"It's a messaging app, nothing amazing. They boast encryption, but media files are not encrypted. Also the quality of pictures sent is reduced, which is terrible. Moving phone is the worst experience ever - one action as developer not intended and whole chat history is lost. People should be able to logon on a new phone and then restore history from old one, but if you logon on a new phone, the old one immediately deletes data."
2,"Great app. Enables connecting all my clients around the world with ease. The ONLY reason for the 2 üåü is because of the image compression. Even after having whatsapp set to the ""Best Quality"" upload option, it compresses the images and video Quality so so much till a point where it is basically unusable (As my work depends on Photo proof of Serial numbers, landscape photos and so on...) Please allow for HD quality photos with NO compression. Then, of course, it will be a 5 Star application."
2,"The picture quality while I upload a photo in my status is terrible, even if took on potrait mode with clear quality, the pixel of the photo completely breaks down no matter what, even in my profile picture and also on status.. whatsApp should fix the bug there. people are searching for a solution to upload photos on the original quality., by uploading in some unknown websites, compressing images and even I did those but nothing helped, HD option is provided in chats rather than on status."
1,After the new update i can't see the status of those whom I have muted .. This creates a lot of problem. Solve this problem quickly I am having a lot of difficulty.. And the new upadate about channels is totally irrelevant for me . I don't have any of its use . Just unable us to se muted status.
2,"It suddenly kicked me out of session, 6digit code message never arriving, and each time I login the apo crashes. I deleted cache, I dont want to re download the app. Ill lose all my chats and media because, by the way, backup sucks. My phone isnt even bad, Galaxy S10. Works excelently. Fix your app"
2,"STATUS SECTION Awesome updates, but here is my experience. The new status pattern is hectic. Horizontal scrolling is time consuming and tiring, please let it follow the old pattern else the new update would affect status view and user experience. Pls bring back the quick (my post) option. It's hectic checking my post from beginning to end. That's really horrible. WhatsApp."
1,"After the newest update, emoji keyboard overlaps with the typing area and Buggs Out. It makes it impossible to modify what I typed. After clicking on Back Button, which previously simply closed the keyboard, it now quits from the chat itself. So much unintuitive and bugged feature... Ruins the whole point of simplicity and convenience for me. It's definitely a pushback."
1,"The new emoji keyboard on the latest update is VERY disappointing. 1. The default position is too low and expanding it is inconvenient. 2. The position isn't even uniform. One time you get the old position, then the new low one. Other times, you can only expand to the size of the old emoji keyboard, other times you can fill the screen. It's so unstable that the app experience has deteriorated to 1 star for me (rated it 4 stars before this uodate) PS, using a Samsung (SM-A536E/DS), Android 13."
1,"This app updates are the worst. It started with the money button. Nobody wants that button!! (really, a terrible idea) but the ""Updated UI with Material 3 Menus and Switches"" is unbelievably bad. Makes switching between text and emoji/sticker way harder and closing the keyboard is now buggy, the screen flashes like refreshing. Also, the app scrolls through all my stickers to reach another stick group, it's ridiculous!! stop messing with what's working and give us folders to organize stickers! :("
5,"Hey Team, it would be great if you can add HD feature for status also. It makes all users really sad when we share HD videos to status but they get blurry or pixelated. Please improve the quality there. If we can have the option of using gifs or short videos as profile picture, that would be awesome. Just sharing ideas.. You are doing an amazing work..Thank you for helping us connect with our loved ones ‚ù§"
5,"Hii everyone. I think i have found a bug probably. I do not get message notifications anymore. The function. To turn it on, Is. Not available because my android system is outdated. Well , my android is up to date. There must be an other reason. I guess, or i hope, i am not the only one withthis issue and you are going to fix it. Thanks in advance!"
2,"Just updated this morning. The new emoji/gif/sticker section is awful. It's bigger than the keyboard and the button to get back on the keyboard doesn't always appear because of that; every time you open it, something different happens. . It's just very poorly done and seems to be lacking an animation which makes it look glitchy, like a random pop up that appears all of a sudden. It's also unresponsive. Just noticed my call history isn't updating too."
1,"Please bring back the old emoji/stickers layout. The new one is annoying. When i scroll, the stickers go to the default one and when i click on the saved one, it takes few seconds to scroll back and it's actually annoying. Just bring back the old layout. The old one much better. And the keyboard becomes delay and stuck now. Just fix it."
3,"Is there any setting for the statuses & channels? I want to turn that channel thing off, I prefer the previous version without the channel one. Before this, I can share my status to Facebook from that 3 dot button, but now, I no longer can. I also can watch the statuses that I have opened by searching my contacts name. But now, I only can scroll the opened statuses which takes too much time. Please fix."
5,"I've been using WhatsApp for quite some time now, and it has been a wonderful experience overall. It's a versatile messaging platform that has made staying connected with friends and family a breeze. But after Infinix Hot12 update, group chat message visibility changed. Previously easy, now unclear who's seen messages. Still love WhatsApp for its features. Hope for improvements."
1,"The new update sucks ! If I try searching gifs, I can't scroll down, because it just reloads and I lose my search. I also don't really like that I can't swipe right to go through all my emojis, that's the one reason I liked Whatsapp better than Telegram. And my stickers are also glitchy, like I can't view my sticker packs seperately, I have to scroll down through everything. Please fix this, or I'll seriously just go over to something else."
5,"I've been using WhatsApp for years now,and I love how easy it is to stay connected with my friends and family using this app.The interface is clean and intuitive,making it simple to navigate,and I appreciate the ability to create groups and send messages to multiple people at once.The voice and video call features work great,and I love being able to share photos and videos with my contacts.Overall,I highly recommend WhatsApp to anyone looking for a reliable and user-friendly messaging app"
3,"I can see option to send hd photos and videos is now available. Please add a setting to enable hd toggle by default so we don't have to manually toggle hd before sending. Slight annoyance is that when swiping right on a photo rather than going to the next photo, it goes to the previous photo. It should go to the next photo. Also deleting messages shouldn't leave a trace otherwise people know you've deleted a message."
4,"WhatsApp is undoubtedly one of the best communication apps out there. It's easy to use for both chat and calling, making staying connected a breeze. The interface is intuitive, and the simplicity of sending messages and making calls is a huge plus. However, there are a couple of areas that could use improvement. Firstly, the video call quality could be enhanced. While the app generally performs well, a boost in videoquality during calls would take the user experience to the next level."
1,"The new emojis display is terrible and not user friendly. I'm trying to see if I can revert to the previous version, it's so annoying üôÑ There is also a bug at least with my Android phone (Pixel 3a) where often an audio message will stop playing if I move my phone at all, again, another very annoying issue, hopefully it will be fixed at some point."
2,"It's actually a good App, but the new Sticker and emoji part is absolutely terrible. I need much more time searching since it always starts on a random sticker pack. I also have a problem with changing the names of a few of my contacts. Even when I close the app and refresh, the name doesn't update. It's just annoying."
1,"The last update made using emojis a mess! When searching for them, the window with text almost disappears on the top screen and one can't actually see what emoji is being used. A lot of useless empty space on the screen. Weird look and clumsy to use. Plus, the ""delete"" button has been moved in a worse position. I wonder why instead of improving a product these developers make it worse! I'm considering to uninstall. There are better and safer ones on the market."
3,"Not a fan of the new ""sticker tray redesign"". The sticker/emoji tray now has an annoying (very slow) animation where the keyboard goes down and then the emojis pop up. This takes about a second or more whereas previously the switch between emojis and keyboard would be virtually instantaneous. Extremely annoying. Also when swiping right on a message to reply, the keyboard no longer pops up automatically. Also extremely annoying."
3,Its a good app. But it has some pull backs like can't upload a video in status which is more than 1080p and cant upload a video more than 30 second if the video is more than 30 second you have to upload it by different parts üòê. Its annoying.... If you could upgrade this it will be helpfull
5,"This is great for communication with friends and family, but I suggest it would be great if Facebook could add an ""edit message"" option for messages sent. It can be annoying and time-consuming deleting an entire message due to one or two errors. Imma come back n give 5 üåü if I see it in the next update. Thanks for adding ""edit"" to messages. Now you deserve my five stars üåü"
3,"While it's adding new features. One it needs to remove? When someone leaves a group/ or removed from group. Only the admin should see this. It causes a negative vibe in the group when this happens. It would be great to see just little image or name of who's read a specific message, like FB messenger does... Hopefully, they keep adding more features."
3,"It was all good untitl the latest August update. When emojis are displayed, sometimes the message disappears. Or sometimes when inserting the emojis, it doesn't show them when they go underneath the text, so the window stays empty which looks like nothing was written ending by 10+ emojis because you would think it didn't respond so you keep pressing the button. Anyway, otherwise great communication tool. Been using it for ages. Emojis are lovely looking, it's easy to use."
2,The latest update with the new layout for stickers is very bad. Everytime I click any sticker pack it doesn't gets shown immediately rather it is getting scrolled to! I have to wait till the sticker comes to the view which is frustrating. Please remove the scroll to feature for stickers.
3,I understand developers wants to make their apps top notch. But honestly guys this last update really messed up my experience with the simple easy to use whatsapp I'm used too. Unfortunately we cannot all afford good quality phones. Please can there be a simpler version for us folk that does not want channels and extra features. Please my whatsapp types in the air and crashes all the time now.
4,"Dear WhatApp. An important feature is missing in the new WhatsApp Channels, the ""search"" button. For instance, I'm a follower of a football channel and I need to find gists about a match that has been played in the past, say ""MUN vs ARS"", using the search button to search for this keyword will ensure I get the information easily. We can't be searching for news manually, that will really be frustrating. The WhatsApp channel is really amazing but the search button can not be left out. Add it ASAP"
1,"History will remember this update. Your designer must search for another job. Every single design choice for the latest update is wrong. But you did it. I hope you can find my old comment. Feel free to contact me for details. This is an example of worst UI design you can tell students. Please rollback or you will lose a lot of users. You removed useful options in sticker selection. Put lots of buttons in busy areas, ... etc."
2,"the latest update isn't welcome on my side. now there's channels, and you can't turn it off. condemned to see Mark Zuckerberg everytime I check on statuses... moreover started an unstoppable backup right in the middle of a chat. two bits of excellent user experience üëé"
1,"The Chat Backup feature is terrible. I tried restoring a backup in a new device and it keeps crashing the app. I can't count the times that this app has messed my backups deleting everything, it's amazing how unreliable it is. Not to mention transfering chats directly phone to phone is equally broken (I have never managed to make this work)."
2,"Hello @TeamWhatsApp. It's been great that you are coming with the new features in every update. But the latest update where you included that channel feature on update tab, is not suitable and good for us. The reason can be that we use WhatsApp only because it make us contacted only with the person whome we know and should be like it was. It's has more user because it didn't connect those people from the external world who didn't want to. So that's why I am requesting you to please work on it."
4,"Good app. I like that new features such as polls and message editing has been added. It would be good if you can select within individual chat settings whether media is automatically downloaded into gallery. For instance I'd like media automatically downloaded into my gallery for specific people's chat (e.g. close friends or family), but I don't want auto downloaded media from certain group chats."
3,"Thanks, whatsapp, you seems like didn't even respond to the user. I have no problems about channel, new features, etc. But this one is messed up, I'll usually make a paragraph in long phrase, but it's gone and replace to a ""send"" button! Why do you have to do that? That's messed up, I hope this will be change ASAP"
1,"REMOVE the channels feature from my App PLEASE, I DO NOT like it, I DO NOT want it :-(, or make it optional for users ro choose if they want it; such unnecesarry features are the reason I don't have accounts on certain plarforms. Let's keep WhatsApp for it's primary goal, you may create another separate app for those who want to aubscribe to channels and get updates, though there's already Facebook for that."
3,"Great app. But The quality of the photos and videos that are sent is terrible. A video at 60FPS is no longer HD even if you enable the HD option when sending the video. It looks horrible with the HD option activated and if not, even worse. An option to send 4K photos and 1080p 60FPS videos would be nice. would improve a lot"
4,"I do like the app, talk with a lot of people on it. but, I can't send the new ""video message"" they rolled out recently. it's like a new feature where you can send short video messages (up to 60 seconds), and the fact that it doesn't work is weird. in general the app works great!"
3,"I really love the app, I basically have no problems with it except for some things concerning status. Please whenever I post a status after saving or downloading a video,the quality of the video significantly drops for some reason.Please you guys should please make it so that when we are posting a status,the quality of the video remains the way it is as it was originally saved. And I also plead with you guys in the next update, please increase the minimum time of a video status to 1 min please."
2,"Please remove the channel option or atleast make a ""hide channel"" option. It's very annoying and useless for me and many people, it's really unnecessary. It's supposed to be a private messaging app and you guys have introduced this hence the concept of private messaging is not valued in the current update. Please make a hide the channel option."
4,"Can you include ""everyone except"" like it is for ""my contacts except"" on my profile photo privacy! There are people in our contacts we don't want to see our pp but would rather everyone else to see it!!! Thanks lots and make it snappy please! You also need to add options on ""who to tag you or not"" in the group messages, so that we can untag ourselves if at all the messages are giving some negative energy!"
3,WhatsApp is a really great app but the recent update has lead to some unwanted feature of finding channels in the WhatsApp status section which is a little bit annoying. There should be an option given in the settings to mute this option also in case if anyone is not concerned with it...
2,The stickers UI is very annoying and cumbersome in the latest update. It is not intuitive and the old UI was much better. I do not understand why change is done for the sake for change and not for improvement. It needs to be reverted to the old UI.
3,"(On my Pixel 7 Pro) the audio messages I play just stop playing for no reason and the screen gets locked, so I have to unlock it and hit play again many times for each audio message. Doesn't matter if the battery saver is activated or not."
2,"Like to address the featire of disapearing messages: as it is configured the app wouldn't bea reliable meanof communication when mesages could desapear by default from your chat. Think that this feature should be restricted to a provat6 hat experience between peers, not unilateraly configured by oneir tge otger part of aconvetsation. Some business relatedn information could be lost with negative consequences for one or both sides ofacinversation. Personally I have to screen capture any mesage .."
2,"This latest update has great features,some improvements there and there but the problem is that it cuts the length of the video status. You will upload a ststus of 0:30 but it'll only play the video for 0:25 or less. You have do delete and re-upload."
3,WHY DID U GUYS MAKE THE VIDEO SO SMALL WHEN PHONE KEPT IN HORIZONTAL ON THE VIDEO CALL. ITS NOT LONGER FILLING UP THE ENTIRE SCREEN LIKE BEFORE PLEASE FIX THIS. dont bring useless backward updates like insta(u guys changed the sticker layout too which wasnt needed. Was comfortable with the previous one but thats ok main issue is video ) does sometimes please . Have no other issues with the app
3,"User friendly app. But you should consider, auto sync for videos that are longer than 30 seconds on the status. Such that there should be an option where I update the video on my status it's cut into multiple 30 seconds segments. Also the 'record audio' on the status update should have a lock option so I can record myself..."
1,"WhatsApp has degraded to a regular messaging app where anyone can message anyone without any filters in place. In the end, selling data is how Meta makes money anyway. No matter how many ads they make on how our data is secure, we can see that our data is sold and random idiots can reach out and message me. It's annoying at best and extremely dangerous at its worst. So much for the 'private' messaging app."
3,The app on itself is good but with the latest update... when we try to post status of 30 secs videos it is by default cropping few secs from the video and any original footage we take from phone camera and try post in high quality... the videos posted in status to to the worst quality. It's really irritating... so would request WhatsApp team to release an update which can fix these.
1,"It is taking more space while using.... It was 9gb data at night and it becomes 14 gb on morning, without downloading any media or backup or any thing... Phone's storage is getting full immediately. It happened after updating whatsapp on 8th of September. It need to be solved as soon as possible."
2,"The old whatsapp is better. I don't like the channel section, I don't like it when I hv to go thru all my status to delete it, everything is perfect except for those two. I think we need to make an improvement of the new update of sticker section bcs it's too hard to handle."
2,"Sticker Board is practically unusable now. I cannot click on a sticker pack's icon anymore, and usually clicking on the icon directs you to the sticker pack. Now I have to scroll endlessly, instead of quickly replying. This trend of apps destroying themselves needs to stop man."
3,The new what's app has a issue that is while typing a message it make the text input to the upper side of the screen while keeping an wide space in between the keyboard and the input taker.... Please fix this issue!! Overall its good...
2,"All good, but the ""edit"" possibility should be removed because how can we trust a chat if it gets edited freely? Or a good way to add security and safety would be to see the edit history of a message for both sender and receiver. Actually, being able to edit a message AND being able to see the edit history for both sender and receiver is the best outcome for me. Keeping the 15mn timeframe to do so is good. I would even shorten it to 10 or 5mn."
4,"For the record I think this app is great until I lost be former device and switching to a new one comes with a serious complexities at accessing my account just because I set up a two-step verification. Why is is difficult for whatsapp to reach me via sms or call for my verification code? This just so disheartening to see the scale of redundancy in one trying to recover his account and I could not get the code, you guys basically need to be thorough in that process of verification of account."
3,The channel feature is useful but dont mess with status tab. Kindly separate both. Pls add new tab for channel updates. Also add delete option for the items downloaded in channels. Clear updates option for each channels is needed. Hope you will add these features in soon. If the channel updats is like web page then not need delete and clear option. Think about it also
4,"The recent update affects the whatsapp status experience. The search icon for the uploaded status of your contacts has dissapeared and has been replaced with a camera icon(which allows users to upload pictures on their status). Needless to say the camera icon appears twice which is absolutely unnecessary. Therefore, I rate this update on 6/10."
1,Each update they keep adding features no one asks for. More and more bloat for something that used to be a simple messaging app. Who ever asked for the channels feature. Atleast include the option to exclude it instead of it cluttering the interface
1,Been using WhatsApp for years now as my main messenger. But the latest update with the new layout for emojis and stickers makes me not want to use them anymore. It's terribly inconvenient and i wish it would just automatically show the 'recently used' instead of me having to go there manually ever. single. time. i want to use a sticker that i use a lot
1,"wrost update ever, i never comment on any app but this is ridiculous. The keyboard side changes is too bad means wrost change, while typing if we add an emoji, text will cut from bottom also if i type long text after sending text the empty spaxe is showing in text Field also if i go to stickers tab from bottom by default scroll is on center while my latest sticker are on top, always move scroll to top for sending latest sticker... wrost"
1,"Very intrusive always wants all sorts of permission to use simply functions, like sending voice notes,view media etc,acts like the Hitler of social media ,give me access to everything or you can't use the app!!! Constantly reconnecting when on a call ,cuts the call off then ask how would you rate the service? Nonsensical!!! Beware this thing is not as private as if let's on ,rather quietly deceitful."
2,"i was a great app, and still is. but since the last update it became annoying. i use a lot of stickers while talking to people. since the update, every time i open the menu it sends me to the emojis instead of stickers and I have to find my way to the last sticker pack I used (I have over 10 so it's awfully annoying) when I finally find it, i have to wait so much for it to automatically scroll down and then it takes even more for the stickers to load. this update was unnecessary, please go back!"
3,"I just hate the way it does backups,it doesn't allow you to stop it. Otherwise the app is good for disclaimer rules on photos and videos. And now the Updates option. It is good when you have business and created WhatsApp channel."
4,"The newest HD feature is so much better, thanks. Would it be possible to make a change so that I can select a group or permanently make all media send in HD rather than having to select it each time I send a picture. Thanks"
1,The recent updates changed the emoji scrolling tray from sideways to up and down it's super annoying. There's channels under the status tab üôÑ for what? The call logs don't show all calls that were sent/received. I honestly don't like this new updateüôå... I HATE IT it's TERRIBLE!
3,Channels update is no e to have but it should have separated tab because of this status experience got affected. Now watching and exploring the status is not user friendly and enjoying and looks like it is not a important feature and channels is taking almost full space of that screen.
3,"They removed the option to be able to select the quality of photos being sent and replaced it with a permanent function to always compress photos being sent. This is not a good things especially if the photo is suppose to be a list of items and price tags, it becomes too blurry for the receiver to be able to view."
2,"The chats makes before like a messages, been updated but there is only one problem is that we can't send the entire video or above 30 sec video in status or send in contacts or groups, and calls are very connective to attract easily but in some times Stop seeding and suddenly stop the app, We know already it's not updated before, but I updated now again sometime it's stoping but not more like before.. I am trying to say that the best to send messages is easy."
4,"Would love if the option of scheduling send messages can be an added feature. As in if the option of setting a time in advance to send a message. e.g a bday wish to be sent at midnight, but I want to type it earlier and schedule it to be sent at 12:00. Or any other message which I want the others to know after couple of days, then I can schedule a date and time for that message and then it will be auto sent by WhatsApp at the scheduled time. This feature is their in emails, which is so helpful."
2,"WhatsApp is one of the brilliant apps out in the market. It's easy to use, and a simple user interface makes it unique among other apps. But, with the recent updates, it has lost its simplicity and has become another annoying app like Messenger. If I want to follow any channel, I would go to instagram or Facebook. Why did you add this option on WhatsApp. It makes no sense at all. It's annoying and totally unrelated to the platform. Now,I don't even want to post status on WhatsApp because of it."
5,"After new update, there's a bug when I call someone. The screen turns black everytime there's a phone call, or me calling someone. Still black screen even after I click on every button on my phone. I can't end the call, the person I'm calling have to do that. After the call is ended, my screen is back.. Fix this, then I'll change it to 5 stars . UPDATE: thank you for fixing my issues"
1,Transferring chairs from Android to Android is really really hard and there are lot of issues with login to other handset with same number . Number of atoms are also very. So it is not possible to switch phones frequently even after all the authentications and authorisations. Now I am confused that which device need to be make as primary and which needed to be used as companion device üòßüòß
2,"Some updated features don't even add especially the channel stuff that you've brought in isn't a good one for example some of the channels I don't understand what they're all about so I cannot subscribe to them. So please I prefer the features we had before that what seeing right now. Plus what you've given as updates instead of status,it's confusing mehn. Just change it back to status it's fine that's what we're used to. Stop giving people a hard time trying to check around"
5,New updation is bad . I've been using watsapp for more than 8 years but I updated it yesterday and had channels on status viewing tab . It's not so satisfying . If it was on another tab it will be convenient for every person . A Other than that everything is perfect .
1,"I find the new ""Channels"" section too invasive, when I'm done viewing the ""status"" it just pops up, nothing interesting and useful, just a bad and cheap copy of Telegram awesome features. The only reason why I'm keeping this app is because most users don't get used to Telegram easy."
3,"Everything is good, but I think it would be better if it had filters like snapchat. It would make the picture better. I know that a lot of girls like taking pictures with filters, and not only girls but boys too, so it would make your app much more popular, in my opinion, and like they say the customers is always right, and I know because I don't have snapchat for reason and now that I take pictures in whatsapp I really miss the filters because like I said it makes the pictures much better."
4,I am using WhatsApp since 3 years. All the features in WhatsApp are so easy to use & understand no complications are found while using the app. It's so much effective & cool. But still I rate it 4 stars because I want WhatsApp to introduce some filters which can be enabled during a video call. This upgrade will be so much bombastic & I am totally sure that many users will also appreciate it.
1,DESIGN is getting worse every time. I don't like to see channels there... I don't care about them... is forced... Back up doesn't work properly... The HD photo function is really slow.. and sometimes delayed on loading the images..
2,"I hate to use this app after the recent update. The channels in the status sections are annoying. I feel harder to chat now because the emoji, GIF, Stickers and backspace have switched places in the keyboard. The app is getting worse update after update. Try to fix is please"
1,"Upgrading whatsapp is really going from BAD to WORST. Uploading status or forwarding messages across is really a scary tale to me, after spending the whole hour trying one thing, suddenly you'll just discover that the status has been deleted. This is so annoying to me, WhatsApp should fix the bug please. And if it's my device, they should react to this and make me understand cos I'm sick and tired of it"
2,Sometimes my WhatsApp suddenly stops working properly...it's like when i try to send videos to someone it doesn't work..it keep showing the video is in process of sending but it doesn't work....basically conclusion is I'm not able to send videos to anybody... Very bad experience from WhatsApp üëé It would be better if you work on this...... Don't disappoint your users üôÇ
1,"Idk why this app is so full of glitches. Everytime I put a status video, the video does not get uploaded fully. Even tho the video does not exceed the 30sec limit and is rather only 11 seconds long, what's app only upload 6-7 seconds of it and no matter how many times I try it just upload in the same way without being complete. Fix it what's app stupid devs"
1,It has to improve a lot It should have app lock so that only the user can open it and not others. There are not many emoticons just like in Telegram. It should have cloud technology. My mobile crashed and dead. I lost all the info when installing it on my mobile. Backing up is not good idea. I am using it since most of the users are using it. In a sense I am forced to use it.
3,"Great app but keeps getting a little worse with each update. Latest, when you try to attach something from the gallery to a message it takes you to the WhatsApp gallery and not your phone gallery. Extremely annoying change! I use this feature all the time and they just added two extra steps/clicks to the procedure. Is there a way to reassign the gallery link?"
1,"No doubt this is the best communication app. But there is an issue anyone who has a GB WhatsApp can easily access your data. WhatsApp doesn't protect your privacy. GB users can see your WhatsApp status even if you don't allow them to see it in your privacy list. And if you delete your status GB users can still see them for 24 hours. Moreover, they can see your deleted messages. What's the nonsense it is."
2,"1. Switching from recently used stickers to fav(‚≠ê) is stressful. They are so clamped together. 2.Once you upload a picture of video from your android device to your status, the quality is reduced about 60%. 3. We need a tab for groups for easy navigation. 4. It's such a pain that you have to save a contact before you can add the person to a group of you're an admin."
3,"Why pop-up notifications are no longer available in my version of android, for a Samsung A22 running android 13, also the individual light color that is set up to identify a contact does not change as it used to, these settings are important for people who at a glance will recognize a particular contact and act accordingly"
1,"The new update is totally tiring, addition of channels, taking away the search features and the status arrangement is not appealing. Whatsapp is now a lot more noisier and uncomfortable than we have tried adapting. Looks so much like Instagram. Let's revert please."
2,"This app works for me so far. But one issue, every time I make a video call a massage says,""WhatsApp is currently recording your audio. Your device's audio recorder doesn't support."" I clicked on 'OK' but this massage is reapeting in every 2 seconds. It looks like whatsapp is trying to record my audio but couldn't. But why whatsapp wants to record my audio? It looks like whatsapp can hear or listen to my chats. But why? Please fix this problem as fsatest as you can."
1,"The last update is really bad .. It has many issues. (1) - The emojis bar updated based on the last used ones, thats good, but the update is slower than my hands, and I always choose the wrong emoji .. (2) - When I send a message with some emojis, the full messages layout is destroyed, and it generates a huge padding from the bottom ""sometimes not always"" (3) - The buttons place changing is a very bad thing to happen as fast as that, I always add new emoji when I'm just trying to remove one."
1,I dont know what happened. But i hate the new layout of the emoji keyboard. Its a hassle to have to drag the emoji menu up and down. I like the old one better. this new one is driving me insane. I will stop using emojis from now on just to save myself the trouble. Not to mention I like using my recent stickers only. After I sent one from the recent tab. it automatically goes to the favourite tab. How annoying. fix it please.
1,"I want to share my photos or videos in the status, yet I can't. Even if I select the best quality in the settings bar, all it does it break my photos or videos to share. This is the reason why I am giving 1 star. I disliked this feature for a very long time."
1,The latest made me give this rating. Unnecessary changes in the interface. Everyone don't need this feature of following a channel on WhatsApp. So i will suggest developers to make the finding channel feature an option which could be enabled and disabled from settings.
3,The app is fantastic! I have a small suggestion: it would be greatly appreciated if you could separate the tabs for personal chats and groups. Managing both in a single tab can be a bit challenging.
1,"The recent upadate of adding channels is kuch a bad move. Like if I have to follow channels I have so many other platforms. Whastapp was one of the few apps which was limited to the contacts. Now it is aimed to be ""insta-cizing"". I would now Uninstall this app and will come back to sms app."
2,"WhatsApp was working amazing. Until recently, the new update has completly ruined my emojis. The previous version was so simple and easy to understand and now they changed it to a drawer system. It's now confusing and just unpleasant to look at. This constant pulling up to even just see the emojis is one big hassle. Either revert it back to how it was or give us the option to change it back. Highly disappointed. Changed something that didn't have to be changed. Please fix"
4,Works great internationally but I wish it has a couple more features: - Ability to schedule messages based on time. - Ability for group video calls. - Ability to pin more than 3 conversation. - Integrate automatic translation.
2,"Experiencing an issue with the emoji interface, when I tap the emoji button on the left of the type bar, it creates a wide open square of nothing, just the background. The type bar ends up on the top and the emoji list in a small bar at the bottom. The interface itself has also changed and I don't like it, you gotta scroll and scroll and scroll to find an emoji, in stead of just tapping the relevant class at the top like before."
2,The whole channel feature has ruined Whatsapp for me. I liked Whatsapp because it was my own small world where I'd only be updated on things from my close friends. I don't want to view those channels. Try to include a feature where we can disable the channels. Also remove the notification when someone deletes a message for everyone.
1,"Dear WhatsApp Support Team, I hope this message finds you well I wanted to provide feedback regarding the recent update of the WhatsApp application on Android devices. Since the last update, I've noticed a significant decline in the transition experience when I click on the emoji option, specifically when trying to access the emojis and GIF page. The transition seems to be slow, laggy, and not as smooth as it used to be in previous versions."
2,So far this is the worst update so far. The search arrow meant for the status is no longer available. The arrow above the status should be brought beside the status as it was the prevision time. The cameras are meant to be one not two. And i am unable to view the channels.
1,"Since last udate few days ago, app is strangely behaving on all platforms of o.s. Calling to and from is a nightmere. Very tempramental. Making call and receiving calls switching ""mute"" on both side. Video calling do not show video nor can speak. Notification sound and vibrating fails. Still it shows notification in the app. Pictures or video do not download or often fail. Restores functions by itself Don't know what is wrong?"
4,I love this app. To communicate with family whom don't know how to type for messages but I hate this new update. We usually record audio as messages and now it's not just the audio but a clip of yourself. And it's only 30secs. No this isn't right. Bring back the old whastapp with just the audio to send and more than 30secs of audio recording.
2,"Um, with the last crash in Germany the audio is really bad. The connection drops many times. Trying to communicate by myltiple calls and distorted audio is very frustrating. Even getting texts can be slow or not match eith timestamps. No matter what caused the system crash just know the audio and connections are eorse than they were leading to the crash."
3,"WhatsApp updated on my phone and now the layout of the emoji/gif/sticker section is completely different to how it was before. You used to be able to toggle between the menus at the bottom of the screen, now they've put them on the top. Every time I try to add a recently used emoji or sticker to my chat, I end up clicking on the different emoji themes instead. This is incredibly annoying. Please give us an option to choose the layout we prefer (top or bottom) or revert it to how it was before."
1,"Pretty bad and when you have an issue you can forget about receiving any support! Since three updates ago I can't make voice or video calls. Tried contacting support five times and all they can say is ""restart your device"" regardless of what I tell them. It seems that support is run by idiots that can only paste what is already on their website or tell you restart your device. They don't read what you tell them the problem is. Forget about it. It's time to switch to Signal for good!!"
1,"I need the old gif, emoji and sticker format back. The scrolling just isn't it. Takes way too much time and it's also buggy. Won't let me get to my first sticker pack on the right but instead always kicks me back, so I have to scroll by myself (as if the automatic scrolling isn't taking too much time anyway). And since the new update, my keyboard always keeps freezing. Have to close and reopen WhatsApp for about 5 times before it works again"
2,"The recent update to add channel is not user friendly. Add different slide as of status, calls ,chats and updates. It seems as if info is crumbled into small space. Please take this experience into consideration."
1,"We currently utilize WhatsApp primarily for exchanging text messages and sharing media content. When it comes to sharing our thoughts, ideas, and content related to ideologies, we already have access to various social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. In this context, it is unnecessary for WhatsApp to incorporate extensive community-oriented features. Instead, I urge WhatsApp to continue prioritizing and strengthening its commitment to end-to-end encryption."
5,"It's been cool so far and it's my main social account. However it's still open for improvements like pinning of status(es). Also, the fact that captions can't be added under your forwarded media from whatsapp is craziliy annoying please work on that. In addition, it would actually be cool if one could get notification when your favoutite person is online, you know..."
2,"The recent UI update has been frustrating. The emojis now live in a retractable drawer and has to be manually dragged up to use. Nevermind the extra annoyance of doing so - the problem is that this conflicts with the ""go home"" gesture on newer phones, forcing you to be extra careful when dragging the drawer upwards. In short, a usability disaster."
2,"Whatsapp worked as a good platform for communication purposes untill the most reason update. For some reason, now I can't receive any messages and it doesn't even show the status of the messages (delivered, seen..) I send. However, when I checked others DO receive my texts so only I can't receive and view their texts. Even reinstalling didn't help. It is quite inconvenient given how I use this for all the communication purposes."
3,I have a problem which you guys have to fix. Some of us who stay in Africa don't have unlimited Wi-Fi in our areas so we have to buy data which becomes expensive to us as they is no option to actually block pictures from loading on its own. The option that is ther is to prevent them from loading to the gallery which is ok but we need the option to block pictures from loading when switching on the data because it eats up the entire data so please add the option
1,"Not sure if this will be considered. But I find really annoying that the app tries to predict the sticker I want to use, maybe based in what I say and whenever I want to use a sticker it just sends me to a random sticker page I don't even want to use. Another annoying thing is the way that the recent emojis update in real time now, because when I want to use one they switch places and I tap the wrong one."
1,"I don't rate and review very often, but this Sept 2023 update deserves 0 stars. They drastically rearranged the status bar, called it ""updates"" and slapped a huge menu of channels that I neither asked for nor have any interest in. It is non customizable, so I can't remove any of it. Stupid."
3,"I think the share screen feature is not good because I can't share the sound displayed by the video. I mean, it's only useful for showing photos not videos. Unlike the Zoom Meet application which allows you to share sound when sharing videos."
4,"A great app indeed. Using this for Years. It would be great if users able to send larger files,videos,images,Documents to others without any limitations. Or you can set at least 2 GB limit for any kind of images,audios,videos,documents, files etc. Then using WhatsApp will more easy for important files or images & videos sharing"
4,"It'd be more comfortable not to display the golden letters message, at the start of every chat. After all, any user should be aware about what this message says, and it only occupies space, and reduces UI quality. The same happens when disappearing messages are configured. It'd be much more convenient to avoid displaying these warnings."
1,"It's a great app and I've been using it for a year. It's very useful for me at communicating my friends and family but all of a sudden i couldn't log in to WhatsApp anymore. I don't know the reasons and I've tried contacting WhatsApp since then,but to no avail. I really wish to get back my account as I have so many important assignments. Please help me get my account back. üôè"
5,"This app keeps getting better and better. Between having the chats encrypted and being able to edit sent texts, plus those helpful checkmarks, I'm sure all will feel great. No stress with WhatsApp. I convert people over constantly. It's the best way to send undisturbed photos. WhatsApp is what's up ‚úÖÔ∏è"
1,"In whatsapp one can create group with 1000+ members. Please add a feature so that one can find messages sent by a particular number/person. Very hard to scroll through thousands of messages in big groups . May i advise to add this feature which can help people a lot. Some time ago I updated this app. In the new version , I can't send any messages to broadcast lists. When try to forward messages, can't find any any broadcast at all. Check and solve please. Very bad experience of updating."
4,"I have loved Whatsapp for a long time. Recently have to lower to 4 stars because it keeps losing draft messages when I switch to other apps. It used to be better at retaining these drafts and since longer messages are the ones likely to be interrupted, it's also painful/harder to recreate the lost draft. Editing messages is a great an overdue addition though =)"
4,"Great application but there need to be improvement in the voicemails. I mean whenever I want to listen to voicemails in the night or any dark area, it will off my screen, and the volume will be so reduced that I found it difficult to hear a single thing from the message. Please improve that. WhatsApp really is a great App!"
4,"The app is amazing and needs no endorsement now. Just facing an issue today (12/9/2023) since morning. My voice isn't going the other side, like not at all. I used üéß also, not no change. The application was updated, so not sure why it is happening. Able to have proper communication on Normal phone calls, but on WhatsApp facing issue."
5,"I've used WhatsApp for several years and found it to be very efficient. It also says all messages are encrypted, which is a very nice feature. I use it to talk to my friend in England multiple times a day and it's very reliable. Graphics and photos are excellent."
5,"One of the best app for calling, texting.. I have a request. It is convenient if the toolbar is placed at the bottom. Repeatedly pressing up with fingers is annoying. Example:- chats, updates and call option"
5,Well overall I really like this app but the new updated version (channels) feature is not suitable for WhatsApp because it's an content app not any channels app so please delete this feature. Thanks for making such a great app I really love it overall to stay in touch with my friends and family üòÅ I hope you will understand ü§ó
1,The present interface is quite tricky. I don't get to see everyones status anymore. I preferred when status not updates was horizontal not the vertical way presently. I wish something can be done to the updates and a search botton should be included.
2,"BUG OR INTENTIONAL? When your read receipt is set to unmark, audio messages get shown as read when the user plays them but other messages stay unmarked as read by the user. Also now in 2023, screen sharing is possible. However the internal audio audio from your device is not transmitted to the recipient"
2,App is pretty good. Fast and reliable. Everything is ok the only issue I am facing is that when I delete messages from my mobile phone the deleted messages are still available in WhatsApp Desktop and Web. Why the deleted messages from mobile app are not synced with web and desktop app?
1,"The new feature that started occurring on my WhatsApp after just updated it is so annoying, seeing pages from Facebook which I'd never asked for is so disturbing, it's not an improvement but a disaster and I'm hoping to stop using WhatsApp for now if that changes can't be corrected, status updates changed to something as annoying as suggesting pages, I think the one who launched the feature should rethink and put it back the way it was,I regret ever updating the appü•≤"
2,"Ive actually never rated whatsapp before as Ive not really had any issues or anything specific to cheer on. But this new ""obtrusive"" and in you face channel thing under status's that cNnot be hidden or switched off is something to rate on. Please allow users to choose whether they actually want to have half their screen taken up like this. if we all.wanted twitter style channels we would use other platforms."
2,"Hey what happened to the options for Whatsapp status? Those great features such as deleting certain stories & share to Facebook have gone! Instead, u add channels & I also feel annoyed by the ""viewed status"" thing where u have to click to see it. That's more complicated. It's best if u bring back the former feature u guys removed & please fix for video calling. Always comes out with black screen instead of the caller."
2,"What is with the last update from October 2023 what are the software engineers and graphicians doing there ? What is with the latest emoji / gif / sticker scrolling and searching repositioning, it's horrible and it takes time to search for them, nothing humanly or logic in it, if it ain't broke DON'T FIX IT! Also remove the ideea that if you dont update the app you cannot use it!"
3,"Not interested in the new features of having channels and updates. Delete it if possible, it's not much helpful. I'd like to suggest a function to double-tap on the chat bubble to edit text instead of having to click 'edit' far on top. Thank you."
2,It's hanging after recent update. My sent messages delivering very late. I am getting messages very late even after another person sent few minutes back. I checked internet but it's working very good. But the issue is only with this app.
4,"Really great and useful app for quick and real time communication. I'll suggest that a way should be made to retrieve deleted voice notes. I've had the unfortunate incident of using the cancel button after recording a voice note and alas, all I've said goes down a virtual bin. I hope this is given some consideration."
1,"""Hi, I want to provide feedback to the WhatsApp team regarding the new updates. I am not happy with them and now it is necessary to take manual backups. Because of it I has loss my all data and chats. Now we feel, it's no more private messaging app.Because it's new features and update of ""channels update"".Now if it possible to make the new features resolve?? Can you also simplify the backup procedure. Thank you!"""
1,"The recent updates of following channel on status interface is worst and I don't think that this should be on the status page.If you want to add that you can do separately like that you have did community making icon is separately designed,users don't expect that with theirs friends statuses there is a big area consuming screen with channels,even then who aren't interested they will not join but it is decrementing the user experience and priority.You may change it to a new interface."
4,"the new UI is not good.. moving emoji/gif/sticker button to upper position? seriously, we've been used it in bottom position like years ago. and when i typing, then wanna add emoji, suddenly the writing bar is like jump in upper position of the display, and make some some blank space"
5,"Good app. You can talk to people by texting, voice call, and I forgot what the one is called where the person/people can see your face. For my experience, it has never quite lagged before."
5,"I've been a long-time user of WhatsApp, and there's one feature I've been eagerly anticipating for years ‚Äì the ability to schedule messages. This addition would be a game-changer for millions of users like me who want to plan and send messages at specific times. Please consider adding this much-needed feature!"
3,"Since the last update I can't backup my Android. I've done all the trouble shooting. It starts backing up and then gets stuck at 99% I've left it for hours at 99% thinking maybe it needed more time but nothing. I checked for updates with the app, play store, cleared Google drive, cleared the cache. Nothing works."
1,"There's a major bug in the latest versions...the emoji keyboard doesn't close correctly after you are done using it, causing a blank space to appear where it was, and that entire region obscures the chat messages until you open the regular keyboard and close it again."
2,"The emoji panel is completely stupid in this new update, the backspace key is in the wrong place now, i keep sending random flags instead of emojis, stickers are impossible to find, the old panel with the options at the bottom were excellent, also the keyboard is buggy, and sometimes opens chats that i didnt tap on. UNUPDATE IT. Every update is just more confusing."
3,"Since the latest update, my video screen does not 'pop out' when I press the left pointing arrow button at the top anymore. If I want to answer a message; send a picture; or even look at another app whilst I am video calling, I can not see the video call until i click on the dropdown again. It's so annoying. Please fix."
4,"The new features are great! They made it way too easier to contact with people.... but I request for one really important feature that integration of SD Card media should also be possible in whatsapp... I mean that, there should be an option to save the media or data files to SD Card. It will be great feature!!! Please make it possible"
4,"Really good app for getting in touch with your friends and family üë™. I wasn't really happy with the app as it had laggy performance and was overall just not that great but, I can tell now that the app is rolling out some incredible features that really make using it more enjoyable. It still has its quirks like lack of customization and all but, it's a solid app to communicate with others seemlessly. So I rate it a üåüüåüüåüüåü out of 5."
5,"Ease of Use: WhatsApp is user-friendly and offers a straightforward interface for sending text messages, photos, videos, and voice messages. This simplicity contributes to its widespread adoption.End-to-End Encryption: WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption, which means that your messages and calls are secure and private, and only you and the recipient can read or hear them.Voice and Video Calling: It offers high-quality voice and video calling, which is especially useful for international calls"
3,"Screen sharing is a very helpful feature in various cases but if there wouldn't be any sound in sharing screen then it's not that useful for formal conferences. Hope, it would have sound system as well very soon. And pls don't reduce the quality of pictures or videos while sharing with others and present options for this is not working."
2,"The new update is terrible and glitches. When I am writing a message, the text goes behind the keyboard and then I have to click out and then back in to see what I last wrote. It also keeps randomly appearing as though I have attached an image, even when I haven't. Just way too many bugs with this update."
2,The current version is not stable. While typing a message it closes automatically. Much disturbance of auto closing. Earlier versions did not have this issue. I feel to go back to the earlier version.
1,Adding new features to whatsapp is always welcoming. As i liked channels veing added recently. But viewing statuses is so cumbersome now due to horizontal scrolling which is worst than vertical scrolling to view other people's status updates. Kindly bring statues to a separate tab with vertical scrolling.
1,"I can't send stickers as a reply to a status. There is no need of the option (delete for everyone) in the chat section when messaging to myself. Emojis are not synchronised with the gboard properly, they are outdated. App is becoming too heavy day by day. Picture & Video quality decreases when we send & receive them through WhatsApp."
2,The recent update with the emoji is going backwards. I don't want to scroll down til the ends of the earth just to find what I need. It's also not like the search keyword feat is accurate. Need the bar at the top back that categorizes the emojis. The sticker is worse since I have over 300+ in the group which I have to scroll all the way past just to reach the next.
4,"Hi, i usually dont have problems with this app,but please BRING THE OLD EMOJI SECTION THING BACK!!! I have been living with this new updated emoji / gif / sticker selection thing for the past week, and i am still having problems getting used to it. The fact that the selection bar with the different sections is down and the delete button is up is the most annoying thing ever i swear. Everything else with the app is fine (video circle feature is weird but i can live with it), just pls fix this...."
2,Definitely not a fan of channels please WhatsApp please remove or make a setting update to hide it not happy with that and sometimes i can be typing to somone n send a message then for some reason my keyboard expands and i can't see what im typing its frustrating i have no idea who came up with that idea of the channel is it really necessary like just go turn on your tv or go to a near by pub etc. Tbh please fix the channels and typing issues. Thanks
1,"Update to the emoji/sticker interface is awful, it's too low and forces users to have to look down when switching from keyboard to picking the correct sticker pack, breaks the flow when typing and sending a message. Don't think making the sticker packs all appear on continuous scroll is a great UX decision, makes it more overwhelming to look for a specific sticker because if you miss it in the pack you know it's from and continue scrolling you get progressively lost, would be better as a swipe."
1,"It's very annoying, whenever I open wapp it automatically comes to home page. I opened it many times And faced same problem. Not happy with it's service Max. Time it gets initialalizing Already it is Updated. But issue is not resolved."
3,"Out of all features this is the best app i've ever used but there's a problem I've been facing for some time, that as I send my status update upto 30 sec, in its 1st 30 sec's it goes ok..but in it's next some seconds it doesn't play and struck in the middle of the video.."
1,"Adding a ""HD"" photo feature is a nice touch, but not being able to set it as default is deplorable. Requires users to check each photo sent and tick the box for EVERY photo. Effort. Please enable HD photos as standard/default in settings. Don't brag about a feature added that requires more work than before."
3,"Dear WhatsApp, TBH, I don't like that you're trying to put Telegram features especially channels. It makes me feel uncomfortable, and it looks messy sometimes. I'm okay with the features that you offered before, but there's something that you guys need to upgrade. First, you guys can try to upgrade the status picture or video to see it more clearly in HD for better vision. Second, you guys can put music in your status for more fun, just like you put it in your Instagram story. That's all."
5,"i came not really about the rating, it's a great useful app. just want to ask for more warning when we download any files from sender in chat. the victim of scammer is getting out of control maybe from a simple feature like BOLD the file format name. that little change might useful. thanksüëç"
3,"Recently, I experienced an issue with my WhatsApp app where it inexplicably occupied 1.5GB of storage, which is normally only 200MB. After analyzing the storage, I discovered there wasn't any large WhatsApp file and only 100MB of data was stored. Reinstalling the app reduced it back to 200MB, but the latest update has caused it to slow down and increase loading time."
1,The recent update has altered the emoji view to have a white background. It was perfectly ok the way it was. The old saying if it's not broken then don't fix it. What was the point of changing something that already worked...
5,"I used this application since long time. This application is truly amazing for messages. In my opinion, this is the best application for messages. By the time, Updates are making added more value to this application. But one thing I have to say about profile picture. Earlier, we could set profile picture according to our own size. But after recents updates, we could not set profile picture in full mode. Now, It has a limited extend. So, if developers could make changes that could be better :)"
1,"Is there a way to permanently remove the channels option? (what is that even?) I don't care about the news or what celebrities are up to right there on my whatsapp. There are so many other platforms for that. I just want to send and recieve messages. Not all this extra stuff that forces us to engage with the app longer than we should. You need to conduct surveys before pushing things like these on people, it's not fair."
2,"the latest update version's msg, voice, video call are not delivered or connected as fast as previous version. i tried feedback whatsapp support about my findings on the previous version which allows me to deliver msg or get thru call video call relatively better than the latest but that bot replied my issue is not problem is base on its statistics gathered. the bot just oversimplify my situation encountered"
4,"Voice Calls on the app are a collossal heachache. Both incoming and outgoing calls. Not a single call is without background interference. Are Whatsapp calls being tapped, because I'm not buying this 'End-to-End Encryption' nonsense with all the feedback, echoing, crackling and screeching noises I get during voice calls. Beyond the app, as far as my internet connection, live location and speaker quality are concerned, there are no issues whatsover. Resolutions please, developers. Resolutions!"
1,"The new update that introduces Channel is so ridiculous. If I am unable to get back the original format, it is pointless to keep this app. I will be deleting if there is no changes by the end of the week. smh!"
3,"I've been using WhatsApp since many years and loved it as it was only family and acquaintance oriented. The new edit option is also good. But the new update is really annoying like if one wants to connect with celebrities then why WhatsApp when there are others apps for this. Even if it is available, there should be a different tab for it not the status tabüòï"
1,This app has started to frustrate with its features. It is becoming worst these days I have been thinking to change my way of messaging even. This app was my favourite and I was highly dependent on it. Now I don't like these features at all.
1,"""Updates"" in the latest app update just messed up most of Status functionalities. Just in case you try to give me the same useless (not-related-to-my-question) answer you gave me through Support Chat: I DON'T HAVE ANY NETWORK ISSUE Latest app ""update"" just killed most of the features that allow the user to manage their own statuses. It's so annoying that it doesn't feel like an update but a downgrade. ü´•"
2,"The newest update has a new emoji interface that is really NOT an upgrade - the emojis take up half the screen, they take longer to load, and it takes way more time to change back to keyboard because the buttons are in a different place. It also happens that an emoji will not insert properly in my text. The text I am typing also does not go up far enough above the emojis. I hope you'll change it back to the emojis staying in the same place as the keyboard as that was much easier to use."
1,"The new update is appalling. The new keyboard design and layout makes it hard and tedious to type. The layout is tiny. We now have to scroll through every sticker or emoji to find the one we want because sideways scrolling is gone. What was once an easy and visually pleasing layout is now hard and appalling to look at. Please either change it back to the previous design, or add the option to swap between the 2 layouts"
4,"very annoyed by this. recently, i was trying to change my ringtone for notifications, but it said that it is ""unable to add custom ringtone"" it literally fails at a feature that most people will customize. i'm very annoyed by this, because i want to change things a bit so things like school groups and freinds groups is more personalized. and that is my only complaint."
3,"New emoji keyboard layout messed up my muscle memory, backspace suddenly goin on top instead of usual on the bottom, I have yet to get used to it because other apps are still using bottom backspace button for emojis. I also feel like it's really difficult to navigate recent stickers especially when you dont have fully 90¬∞ screen corner edge, and without navigation button (using gesture). Need to press it few times for it to pick up. I think Iprefer the older style of emoji keyboard layout."
1,"Poor upgrade, swiping to reply chats does not bring keyboard up automatically, cancel a status and it'll still be playing even after you've left the screen and you can't stop it, new chats in an opened chat drops u see the screen, you'll have to scroll up to see it, only emoji interface looks cool"
1,"I tried the Message Yourself in the new update. To my horror, the name shown in the ""you"" account is under a different name (one of my contacts). The photo is still me. I checked my profile in the setting. The name and the phone no. are the same as before (as usual) but it said ""this is not your username or pin. This name will be visible to your WhatsApp contacts"". Now officially WhatsApp recognised me as a different person??? Have been a happy user since 2010 and there is no issues. Bug?"
5,"So far, I love the whatsapp user infterface improvements. We have seen really lovely updates on the app since recently, especially the screen sharing feature. May I suggest that the screen sharing feature is also allowed on audio calls and not just video calls. Currently, one has to be on video before screen sharing is visible. It'd be nice to have it on both video and audio calls as it is a very important feature in this age."
3,"I'm here after the most recent update. I hate that we can't delete the statuses at all once. It's a hassle when we have to delete the status one by one, by clicking to 'option' button. Some of us are just really like to spam those and delete it at all once later, pls considerate to bring the function back. Thanks"
2,"Last few updates are just awful. So so so buggy, devs should know not everyone has the newest phones and be able to optimize the app for it to work decently for everyone because so many people count on this app for communication. The new stickers and emojis menu is so uncomfortable and buggy, it's trying to compete with the iOS layout but it simple doesn't work on Android, don't get me started on how uncomfortable it is combined with the gesture features, optimize your app"
1,"after the most recent update it keeps on lagging, making it difficult to text quickly like it used to. the emoticon interface is difficult to use, it doesn't show my ""recently used"" first anymore and it makes the chat freeze. new messages don't show unless I scroll back down sometimes and it takes ages to load after I close the app even for 3 minutes."
1,"GIF in profile photo. Option to put a song or several when I open the app. Option to trim the voices. Translate messages to another language. Put whatsapp multicolor, or at least let me change the color inside the app. Convert a voice into message and viceversa. Let me put a name in my personal folder, because there only appear my phone number, I want to deside; adding my avatar will be a great idea too. Put a tab of messages instead of presing the button. Increase the limit of uploading videos."
3,"It's a good app generally, but I have a few problems that make it finicky and frustrating to use. Firstly, it randomly decides not to notify you when you get texts, even if you're notifications are on. Secondly, it takes up an astonishing amount of storage, which I understand, but it's still annoying. Last of all, it sometimes completely wipes your previous messages with no warning. It's typically not that hard to fix, but it's stressful and a waste of time."
2,"Well, finally a change to few features and looks, so I have to raised it by two stars. But please seperate groups and private chat and improve incoming call (Whatsapp often cannot receive call after lockscreen) If the problems I mentioned above fixed, I will raise my star for each problem. EDIT 1: Still no luck. Star decreased by 1 üíÄ"
1,It stopped logging me in a while ago. Keeps showing it can't send sms or call on my number. While my number is absolutely valid and active and receives sms and calls. Support is robotic keeps sending same robo message. Zero help. I had couple important contacts there and was using it quite often. Now im disconnected. That is how you treat your customers?!. Will never use again this s and will tell others to stop using in order not to lose contacts.
3,"This app is very useful but the things for which I gave it only three stars are- 1. It's video call quality is very bad, there is a lot cliche and eco in the voice . 2. Whenever we delete a message it shows that ""This message was deleted by you"" on my phone and the other persons phone it shows ""This message was deleted by xyz"" . I don't have very much problem with the second thing but with the first thing, I have."
1,"I feel the new feature for adding channels is useless. WhatsApp supposed to be a private platform to connect with your closed ones and not to follow others and keep updated yourself by subscribing the celebrities or the so called influencers on their channel. Please if possible remove this feature for better. We all have different platforms to keep ourselves up to date, I feel there's no need of such features on WhatsApp."
1,"My account has been locked twice and its under review for 24hr. This is happening for the 2nd time in a same week. I am so frustrated with your service. There has been no unethical activities done with my account still it has been locked twice. After being your user since the beginning of the app launch, I have never faced any issues. I request you to kindly review my account and make it safe again for use."
1,"I do not appreciate the recent update to the app where 'Communities' remain part of the active chats and cannot be archived or moved to the extreme left panel where they should have been from the beginning. We, the users of the app, do not care about the new features available enough to the point where we are forced to make constant use of them. If we want to use a feature, give us the option but don't make it mandatory."
1,"Are you guys going to fix the problem I mentioned below? Thanks. I have been uninstalling and reinstalling my Whatsapp on my Oppo phone because the stickers are not working. They were working fine after installed but the next day, they are not working again. Please kindly fix the bugs. Thank you."
1,"I was totally upset on security of our WhatsApp where if someone logins in my account by chance, and in two step verification process settings under change mail address it simply taking mail and accepting it. No code verification is asking to the mail which have already registered on it. its simply accepting new mail. It's totally vunerable when someone login and change mail address related to my WhatsApp account."
3,Today i observed if i do a group video call and i see that entry in calls section but it was somehow showing my own number in the logs. I have taken a screenshot but unable to add it here. It was not showing previously. Also it should not show the number when my own number is also saved in my contacts. So either it should show You or my name if you want to show that in group call instead of number.
1,"Custom stickers stopped working after the recent updates. They will not load and I'm shown an error message saying it might be my phone's battery saver mode affecting this. My phone is not on battery saver mode, and even when it was, the stickers used to work prior to the update. I tried to contact Whatsapp support via the app, but it's just a bot that doesn't answer any questions and is not helpful at all in solving my problem."
5,You added this chennel feature in the status column in one channel the messages in the given chart is very big so I hope you keep this messages size in other charts of a regular WhatsApp. New updates is very interesting we can send photo in HD the emoji pad is changed the WhatsApp looks very beautiful by this update.
1,I love whatsapp but the new feature to allow someone to edit a message after they have read it is terrible. You can even edit your message AFTER someone replied to your message. That's ridiculous. Will no longer be able to use this for business communications
1,Newly introduced channel function is not at right place. Either we have a different Tab for it or we should not have this. Currently mix of this function with status/stories is looking congested. @whatsappteam pls look into it and provide better interface.
2,"After the update, the experience became worst. At least there should be one platform where our privacy should be maintained. Or we feel homely. The inclusion of channels in updates section is very irritating and sometimes it feels not to open WhatsApp at all."
1,The recent update is terrible. As people are already commenting about the emoji/gif menu being a disaster I'd request you to please stick to the previous design as it was super convenient for us to use emojis/ gifs/ stickers way easily. Apart from that uploading a video as status is occurring some serious issues. It's just showing error and saying the file is not supported. Which should not have been a case as it's always a mp4 file within the size limit.
1,"All of a sudden the enter arrow to start a new paragraph has been changed to ""send"". I absolutely and strongly dislike this as it is most inconvenient when writing to friend. I have also tried multiple ways to check the keyboard and its functions in other apps - all appear to be with the enter arrow EXCEPT WhatsApp!!!!!!!!"
2,"Used to be the best messaging app out there. You removed the search button on status. Please can you make the channels optional, whatsapp used to feel private previously, now feels like it not safe especially seeing the faces of people I didn't add up. Don't suggest people channel to me. That even why I stopped using Facebook (you keep suggesting people I don't want to know). Your new update is annoying."
2,"The status uploading quality was so bad and also the profile viewing options were not working at all. If we decided to choose the option some of the person only can able to view the profile, but it still showing profile to every contacts."
1,"I have an active sim which belongs to me only,still whatsApp is not sending me the otp to relogin to my new phone device or any of devices. It says ""you have tried so many times"". Why this is happening,it is my account and i believe I have got all the right to login to any devices of mine. You don't even have any customer service number Or a direct live chat executive who can resolve the issues on time"
4,This new update comes with beautiful ideas but I just think the user interphase can be more better. Why not split the status and channel into two different pages instead of both being on same page . Great work by the team though.
4,New update on how the status appears horizontally is not helping. You can't see the time of post anymore. Just the profile picture shows. Can it go back to the vertical way with the time of post.. Thank you
3,"I'm using WhatsApp for 5 years now. I found most of the things great but as a human my needs would never end so I wanted a few more features mentioned below 1. There should be a option to pin messages in WhatsApp chats specially in groups. 2. As we have separate sections for status, chats, call and broadcast. WhatsApp must also provide a separate section for groups. It becomes very difficult without that. Include this 2 rest I will suggest later.üòÉ"
1,I really hate the fact that I can't post high quality videos on my status without the quality being reduced. Please fix that. And if you're trying to help us manage data then you can add the feature of choosing the quality we'd like to post in. I hope you fix that as soon as Now
3,"Sir, after updating the app, I am seeing a new feature Channels under Updates which was seen as Status earlier. I wish to disable n opt out of this new feature but cannot as there is no option seen to delete nor to opt out. Kindly let the user have an option to accept, reject, delete or opt out of any new feature. Let the user decide whether any feature is useful or not. We the users need this right to enable or disable any new feature that gets added when the app gets updated. Pl resolve it."
3,"Nothing is ever perfect, but Whatsapp is quite close. A few handy features and fixes and it will get there. The quality of photos that are shared dropping considerably is a very big inconvenience. Whether you are sharing to your status or to friends, the quality is horrendous. If they could fix this then if would at least be a 4.5 stars"
1,Extremely unhappy with the new update. The placement of the emoji categories at the bottom is a surprisingly difficult change to adapt to. Uncomfortable and annoying to use! Please bring back the old format.
1,"Unusable. While trying to enter my phone number it keeps saying ""Unable to connect. Please try again later."" even though after clicking the ""Check status"" button it says ""WhatsApp service is operating normally."" It failed connecting using WiFi and Mobile data connection."
2,For oneplus users there is an issue with the status upload.. Quality of images or videos are highly reduced after updating the status but the actual images are of high quality..Whatsapp should come up with some option to upload status like low quality or high quality..
5,I want a feature to be added. I want you to put in a feature where we can schedule messages to be sent to individuals or groups at a time or date in the future. Such an update too can be added to statuses where we can schedule a status update for a future time or date. This would really help users in not missing out on sending out or posting important messages or files. This will help users to also plan ahead of time and not miss out on anything especially posting people on their birthdays.
1,It used to be a great bug free app earlier. The recent august update made it horrible app to use. The interface for emojis is changed and it is so difficult to use. Such a bad interface with so many bugs. With some contacts i am not able to see if they are online or not even when they have allowed to show me that they are online.
3,"The last update has the ""Status"" feature all messed up. Please put a ""hide"" button in there to hide the ""Channel"" garbage. All I want to see is the status of my personal contacts, not public figures"
2,"If you want to add those channels, please just put it on another tab, this new layout is just unnecessarily cluttered. Going to a tiny portion of the screen to view statuses if far from ideal"
1,facing constantly problem with forwarding files media and other media files. it's taking too much long time to process the data and some times it didn't work after taking so much time. I think whatsapp is no more concerned about its services and facilities.
3,"You messed up with the update, the 3 dots next to my status update is missing, i can't select from my own story, Plus we need an option to block call certain people from our contact without necessarily blocking the person It's based on somone last status post we check his status, now you canceled that with a profile picture we already have their contact, we need a preview of the last status back"
1,"This a great app for communication but the recent update is just not working out. The emoticon layout prior to the update worked well and was user friendly. After the update, it's been lagging, it takes up half my screen preventing me from viewing what I'm typing and it crashes after I insert one emoji to my chat bubble. The layout is certainly not aestically easy on the eyes either. Please resolve these issues or revert back to the previous layout because it certainly worked üëå"
2,"I can't watch any videos on my status again or send any recording videos to any of my contacts again. The error message is There's an error playing this video. I'm confused right now, what can I do? Do something about this video unable to play when they send me videos"
1,"Blur the pictures and specially video quality is worsened when posted on status or sent to someone. Doesn't show notifications sometimes even tho the notifications are on so I have to open the app every single second to check if there's a text. Next is Calling. Calls are trash. Background noise is too much, audio is choppy, distorted or very low..It always shows call failed whenever I call anyone or anyone calls me so I have to turn the vpn on every single time to call anyone.trash app trash app"
4,Now recently you add channel feature not so comfortable with that it should only visible to business accounts as it somehow I thought interruption to privacy and it's interphase actually what if someone accidentally touch it . It should appear in another window not in Same window with status .Somehow irritating feature for me üåù
1,"Messages that am sending to clients are not going through. Personal messages going through. But the rest, just some huge exclamation mark and ""can't send"" notification. This is really frustrating. Then there is no option for contacting support. No contact one can call and the group support chart there are no replies. Very Frustrating!!!"
3,i personally don't like when WhatsApp compressed my video quality from the HD to the blur one. I'm edited the video using the 4k graphics and it'd be compressed like so much. and then when i compressed my own video (just for the size) it still come out the same!
1,"Very disappointed with change in the buttons position. 1. Search option is replaced with camera on Status tab (which is now Updates tab) which is now twice on that screen. 2. In Emojis panel, search option is also moved to top left from bottom right (which is very inconvenient)."
1,"This new update is 5/100. I'm yet to see the essence. Everything you changed in the Status setting is not necessary, it only makes the interface more difficult to use, plus have to start viewing my status from the first one before I get to the status I want to check again."
3,"It was a good app but now the channel feature is very bad.....WhatsApp was to connect to relatives but the channel feature shows celebrities..... WhatsApp is not required to Connect celebrities the other apps like Facebook, Instgram are already there ..... So I request WhatsApp to add an option to disable the channel feature as per the need of User. Hope that WhatsApp will look into the gravity of the matter......."
1,"The latest update is awful. The way they restructured stickers, gifs, and emojis is so wrong. It slows down the response time and practicity. Really if something is not broken, do not try to fix it. Change it back"
1,"New update from August 14th is riddled with bugs and ruined a perfectly good layout. Gaps between emojis have been increased, so you'll have to scroll further to find the ones you want. The bottom quarted of the foreground of your chats disappear and the message box takes up more of the vertical length of the screen at random, even when empty. I hope they roll back these changed in the next update, but I doubt they will."
2,The new layout for emojis and stickers is awful! Much more difficult to see them to make a choice! Too few visible at a time. Please go back to the previous layout. The only thing that needed to change was the tendency of stickers to be sent by the slightest accidental touch.
2,"So far, so good, I use it to make international calls, but for some very odd reason, if I connect my Bluetooth buds while on a call, they won't auto connect. I have to cut the call, close the app, and re open it just for the mic to connect, and it's become tiring. It's been going on for 4 months now."
4,"Dear WhatsApp Team,I appreciate WhatsApp's strong communication, security, and privacy features. To improve the user experience, I suggest a more secure hiding place for private chats, the option for animated profile pictures, and the ability to customize the home screen background. Additionally, a notification for when contacts are online would enhance connectivity. These enhancements would make WhatsApp even better without sacrificing security."
4,The updates on WhatsApp are becoming too frequent taking away some functionalities. I want to be to share status to my Facebook Story and add music to it. The new update gives me the option of sharing to Facebook ruling out the possibility of adding music. Please look into it. I don't like how WhatsApp is automatically linked to Facebook story. I want to be to make edits and add music by myself
1,"Love WhatsApp but the new update is terrible. The new emoji & gif layout is now awkward to access and it glitches. I understand wanting the gifs to be nearer to emoji but by doing this you've made accessing the basic facilities difficult. Sometimes just keep it simple! The new features - access to channels is a bit over the top too... That's what snap, Facebook, Instagram is for. WhatsApp is an app for quick comms with family & friends, don't destroy WhatsApp :("
1,Meta ruined this app. The only reason I'm still on this app is because I'm in a bunch of groups that I've been in since before Meta bought this. All my friends and family are on it as well and it would be near impossible to switch from it. And now I have updates from celebrities that I don't care about. Stop making this a social media app with random weirdos and keep it a messaging app for close family and friends!
2,Is anybody else having trouble with their profile pics that keep disappearing? I put up a PP and not long after I notice that it's blank again. Go to upload a profile pic again and before I know it it has disappeared and I'm left with a blank PP AGAIN. Has been happening for month and the stupid chatbot is useless at trying to understand the problem. Also keeps removing my contact names. Sometimes my chats are just listed by phone numbers even though my contacts are saved by name. Frustrating.
1,"The recent update is so very annoying,the app seems to be slowing down,I can't even search for a name on my status block,it seems the true essence of the app is being jeopardized,it's the most private media we have,why is it being turned to a public media? Every other update is okay for me but not these.... Please resolve this issue and bring back the WhatsApp we've always loved. The app deserves a five star but after these just NO."
1,"WhatsApp, please retain your essence as a simple messaging app. The recent introduction of features like Channels, Communities, and Status is steering the platform towards a social media path. While innovation is appreciated, these additions detract from what made WhatsApp special ‚Äì private, one-on-one communication. Let's not lose the charm of straightforward messaging amidst the noise of social media."
5,"As a beta user, this lock feature is cool but it takes time to unlock it there is small animation whenever we open it it's pretty cool ngl, but it's slow and if I open it from the notification it doesn't open up properly or to say the chat doesn't open up even after entering to code or having to use fingerprint all in all very nice features but minor tweaks are appropriated thanks"
5,"Super,Excellent& It's fantastic Simply. I would suggest something currently that 1)Status viewer's search option would be very useful if viewed by more users it's more difficult to find out by using current option 2)if possible Some other tab like to add some web site extensions as a plugin then we can watch that page browse simply using buttons 3) specially for groups hiding mobile num last digits as ** then it might useful for some girls security reasons based on the approval only can see"
1,"I just updated my Whatsapp and I absolutely hate this new version. It's annoying and frustrating to navigate (the emoji and stickers rearrangement was absolutely unnecessary and extremely confusing). It literally hangs and that thing it does when I drop my keyboard, I don't even know how to explain it. It's a mess, really. Please do something about it. It's sad and annoying."
3,"It's the basic texting app and it works, but most of the time image restoration on contacts don't ever load, and It's not letting me have WhatsApp logged in on my phone and my tablet, I can't switch between devices for texting every second"
1,"I rated this a 2 before but now it's a 1. This new update is rubbish or Mark üòí especially with the status part. We can no longer search for status of other persons any longer and we can't even pick a particular story of ours to view any longer, y'all forced me to update and tbh it's not it and who needs ""Channels"" fgs?! + Why is the quality becoming worse and worse? HD pictures be showing in 240p why? Please fix it. Thanks."
1,"There is some glitch i can't see status anymore. Just random channels. Add a feature of only receiving calls from the saved contacts, there are better options for messenger apps tbh , do something so that people don't leave yours."
2,"Why does Iphone provide a better experience than the Android counterpart. Now we have garbage status quality and pictures have to be toggled to have a better resolution. Just set them to the highest out the gate, this should be standard not a feature"
1,"They ruined all stickers and gif experience after last update. Lagging, refreshes when it doesn't need to refresh, constantly jumping and refreshes after each time you press a sticker. Just the worst and most annoying experience."
4,"Hello WhatsApp I give you 4 stars because you guys are really trying to give us the best in the app. We appreciate you for that. But for this new channels update, I don't think its necessary for the app. Its turning WhatsApp into Instagram and it doesn't look good Please find other ways of improving the app or better still organize the way the channels would be Hoping for the best!"
1,"The latest update of introducing channels sucks. There was no need for such things as it's already on Instagram and Facebook. The whole status screen UI has been ruined because of the channels symbols there. If it's so, then please add some features to hide the channels or to mute them. Whatsapp was always for personal chats and news, but now, as social media channels are coming on, it will become the same as Instagram or Facebook. The personal space feeling on whatsapp will there be no more !"
5,"The best application to stay in touch with friends and family around the world...it just gives distance a new meaning. There is distance, but people on this app are not distant. Thank you Whatsapp for connecting me with my loved ones."
4,"The current version of this App fix the font size of text statuses to a tiny font size... the previous version that allowed the message to fill the screen was better for me than this one... If I am not mistaken, the limitation was charactors - less charactors allowed the message to display bigger fonts... more charactors made the message fonts smaller which was fine. Another idea when posting a longer than 30s video, is it possible to develop an automatic cut of the clip to your allocated 30s"
5,"All over experience about this app was good I liked how we can give reactions to Messages of other people calling preference also had pretty much nice quality......,Also noticed some weakpoints...1) photo quality is not good, photos captured in camera by whatsapp(if it has text) ; the text gets black in color, might had thought that it was any sort of glitch but noope 2)Fingerprint functionality wasn't working properly it still remains unlocked still i have set it lock immediately, please fix"
2,The new update (channels) screwed up with the user interface. Kindly give a choice to the user whether to use a new update or not. You can't force a user. Btw the update of channels suggestions is making a communication app into a social media üòï I am extremely unhappy with your response given by your customer service chat group team on the same. At least have the courtesy to understand the concern. üôè
2,"WhatsApp is good until the new update brought a new feature which I could not see as any help. I don't see see anything better in channels status. And again, the status search is not available as well. This is disappointing."
3,I really like Whatsapp for a messaging app. I gave three stars because I do NOT like the new feature 'Channels'. Please tell me how to delete it from MY phone. I do not follow anyone and DETEST seeing it every time I look at my status'!!! Please make a way to get rid of it!! Thanks
2,"We appreciate all the new developments except one , the thing about channels of interest please leave what'sapp to be intimate . We have Facebook and Instagram for that with the strangers let what'sapp be what it has always been, a messaging app . Where your choice of people , family and friends contact you not all this allowance to strangers . Let it stay intimate."
3,"I'm using WhatsApp on daily basis and i'm shocked when i opened it today. As someone who used the sticker tray a lot, somehow it makes me to adapt again. Another one after the newest update, when i swipe a bubble to do a reply, the keyboard doesn't appear immediately as usual... + the app got a bit slower even after i delete memory and caches, it really bugs me, if it's possible to fix it i will be really thankful üôèüèº"
2,"The new update on Whatsapp is very poor. Why I am saying this, you can no longer just see the time a friend updates his/her status unless you tap to see the status. Unlike the previous one. Restore the old status update. It's more convenient than this new one."
1,Has issue sending HEIC photos. Please add option to easily navigate through old conversation and add option to search chats by date. It takes a lot of time to scroll through months worth conversations. Add back the ability to search group broadcast name.
4,Don't see the point of disabling screenshots altogether in disappearing photos. Atleast allow the user to toggle it off for themselves if they don't mind their photos being screenshotted. Or allow it on a per photo basis. The point of disappearing photos was to not clutter the storage and save only what was needed (by taking screenshots). This completely removes the benefit and reduces it's usecases to extremely few. Please allow users to toggle it off for their photos.
5,"Whattsup has been effective way of communicating with people, either text or voice messages, and the is no limit on texting. Is time saver, meaning one can communicate with couple of people at a time."
2,Whatsapp has always been great but this most recent update has been so buggy. Whenever I open the emoji/Gif section it glitches and all of a sudden I'm not able to see the message I've typed and have to exit & re-enter the chat to have it work. The update looks more sleek but the glitches absolutely suck
3,"Generally a great app, my favourite app to communicate with.. but I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the sticker tray update. It has slowed down my WhatsApp slightly and also made it longer to open my emojis, it also does not reset to my recent emojis section when I close the app and reopen it anymore, so it is more confusing to navigate, so disappointing. Also the making your own avatar thing does not work well for multiple reasons, I wish they'd undo this whole update."
1,There should must be an option for logout in whatsapp so everyone can easily logout it whenever he wants to take break from receiving messages or connecting people. WhatsApp gives you only 2 options that is delete account or change number but why WhatsApp developers are not working on ut to make an option for logout. Moreover when anyone want to take break he deletes whatsapp and there is a danger of data loss and sometimes we don't receive new messages when reinstall after deleting it.
1,When you. Off the. Media visibility. 8n the sitting. For. This. Who have alot of group. When some one. Send you. Video. Or pic. So that will automatically download. So when i off the visibility. After. That. I dont have any way or. Right to download the. ( Document form pic ). So please add option. To download documents form. When media visibility is full. Off. From sitting. Thankyou
2,"For Android this app not so good... if you recieve a call there is only the sound and no notification to answer. So you have to open the app, let it react, hit the green part of the screen and hope the one who is calling doesn't hang up."
4,I am not at all liking the current view for the status updates. It's like Instagram and Facebook. We cannot even see the full name and the time that last status was updates by some person unless we open the status to view. Please change it back!!!
4,"Otherwise works really well and I have no complaints, but the audio messaging in WhatsApp is just terrible. If I try to listen to an audio message sent to me, it often shuts my phone and makes it incredibly difficult to listen to any audio messages. I hope that gets fixed ASAP."
1,"i don't like the way the emojis panel shows up, i used to choose an emoji then send a message right away, but that's not possible with the new lay out. the ""send"" button is just too far above the original place, so when my muscle memory press then button, now i falsely press the ""backspace"" button instead of ""send"". my suggestion is to keep the height of emoji panel the same as keyboard's height."
1,New interface sucks! The emojis screen is backwards and too small to select your emojis. Cannot see what I am typing as the textbox is moving. When typing long message the whole textbox dissappear. Previous version was so much better. Please fix this.
3,"Update: Two hours after my review below, the issue seems to have corrected itself on its own. Will update review if the situation changes. Original: Issue since the last update on an S10. Emoji keyboard does not raise properly. It pops up too low and only the top border is visible at the bottom of my screen and I have to drag it up to access emojis every time. It basically makes emojis unusable right now. Phone restart and changing keyboard does not resolve the issue; it is a whatsapp problem."
1,"The channels update is the absolute worst. If this feature is going to be enforced on users, at least give the option to hide that entire section. WhatsApp is for communication, it's not some random social media app. I don't care for & neither do I want to know about celebrities or brands. This is only abetting the spread of propaganda & shallow PR news. Start creating features that users actually request/need instead of weird stuff like this. I regret having my auto-update enabled for this app."
1,"With the new update of having channel, WhatsApp doesn't seem like a private messaging platform anymore. It feels more like that of social media platforms where you can follow anyone you don't even know. I felt like it's violation of privacy. It would be great if there is an option to choose whether to show them or not. Not like suddenly popped up when you go to see ur friends and family status."
3,"This new version of WhatsApp is whack! It defeats the whole purpose of the app. WhatsApp is supposed to be a private space where I have just my family and friends - a place where I choose who I want to have there. Why did you add the channels feature?! Why throw my private space to the whole world? To top it all, they now removed the search button for status, that's just bad. And I can't find the muted statuses. What's going on?ü§ßüò≠ Please do something about it ASAP!"
1,"The newly introduced channels are completely unnecessary, we are okay with the one we are using before, manipulating others won't do. WhatsApp is end to end encrypted and let it be like that. Thanks"
3,Hi WhatsApp. The user interface for the status view and channels. Can it be separated into two. Instead of adding the both to the update interface.. Otherwise someone like me wont view People status.. Thanks
1,"The App has a bug on my phone and wont open, deleted and reinstalled and still the same. Also got an error saying there is a bug and I must wait for the app developers to release an update with a fix for the bug"
3,The app is just not working right. Especially after the current update. It's like a bug was included or something. The emoji board disappears every time I try to put an emoji on my status. The type box doesn't respond properly to the emojis either. The gap is just to big. As much a I love the update but it's glitching making things a little bit difficult. So please fix it
4,I use it all the time (and have done since it was first released many moons ago). The latest update appears to have brought in a new animation when switching between keyboard and emojis. It is very annoying and really breaks my flow when writing messages :(
1,"My account has been blocked for no reason at all and nothing seems to work. I cannot login even using another sim and creating a new account. I am a senior citizen and without whatsapp I lose my only way to contact some people. For such a popular app, there should be more ways to secure account especially for senior citizens."
3,"Dear Whatsapp/Meta developers I just want to humbly request an update: May you please make ""message starring"" visible to both parties, because it's another way to show someone that you appreciate their words or Point of view. Also please return the status screen/options back to the way the were.(the current one is very restrictive) Thank you for the app üíØ‚úåüèæü§òüèæ"
3,"The recent update to the stickers and emoji layout was totally unnecessary and quite confusing. Also the new update is buggy, after viewing a status it still shows for a few seconds before to the already viewed ones. Please fix"
1,"Very bad experience with the latest update. When clicked on the emoji icon, need to pull the emoji drawer from bottom of the screen. This is really a painful user experience. Hope it is restored back."
4,"I have noticed that the vibration setting for notifications is the same, be it default, long and short. The only option working is when the vibration on off. It would be good if this can rectified for better experience."
5,"It's great app literally..so useful that I can't describe how much it's useful to me as a person, as a family member and as a student..BUUUTTT just one little suggestion, could you please add the opportunity to put group chats in Lists like study list..family list and like that, like I have many study groups so it became messy And mixed with my family groups and my other groups and I just can't, it's all messy now..so please Do it I'll be thankful."
1,"A possible response to express frustration with WhatsApp's message notification sounds not being audible could be: ""WhatsApp's message notification sounds are unbelievably unreliable, causing major inconvenience and frustration."" TRY TO FIX THIS I GAVE ALL PERMISSIONS AND ALSO I RESET NOTIFICATION IN THE SETTING!"
3,"After the latest update, the gif section isn't working properly. When I want to search in the gif, it first shows the search results and then after scrolling, it returns to the first page after some seconds of buffering. Please improve it."
5,Hey...New updates are always welcome... but in this new updates there is no option to search a person by typing his/her name to check the status on Status tab which now becomes Update tab... also status which we kept there was one option (vertical three dots) from which we directly see our any status.. in which we can see our status seen also we can directly delete any in between status.. please check this mistakes because these may be small mistakes but very helpful for any WhatsApp user
1,"This app is TERRIBLE! Had problems with WhatsApp recently, so I had to reinstall it, but after verification, WhatsApp says that I don't have the backup on my Google account, but I certainly HAD backup my files! So I lost ALL THE INFORMATION FROM MY CHATS! THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!! Telegram is SOOO MUCH BETTER, FOR REAL!!!"
3,"Hoi Fix the app ya meatheads. How'd you downgrade from being able to delete multiple statusses at the same time to having to delete one by one of the statusses. Also, Sometimes When I post videos on my status they don't post the full thing. It only posts like 7 seconds from a 23 second vid. What gives."
1,"Unnecessarily, channel suggestions. I don't need it. And one of the major problem is that there is no option to skip or ignore it. I'm not interested this type of setting or recommendations. Please provide the skip button, or never reminder."
1,"Please add the icon to delete a status back to original place when viewing status instead of the menu.. also I want to be able to select the statuses I want to delete. remove channels or give us option to hide them like you did with muted statuses, make text box back to what it was... whatsapp was fine don't update anything but emojies and maybe better ai to generate gifs Thank you"
1,"about your recent update. There's no longer search button for statuses, people with large contact list will find it very difficult to navigate through individual statuses."
1,"In app info on your android phone's settings, go to the top right corner of app permissions. It is All App Permissions. There, one scrolls way down past 30+ extra permissions auto grantedü´£Reorder running apps is one, as is full network access, & control NFC!"
4,most of the things seem to be fine. but why does it keep freezing whenever am trying to add filters to photos before sending. and also the limitations of the number of files to share at the same time. it's really frustrating otherwise thanks for the improvements and please work on the worst parts. especially for the photos filters
1,Updating is good but current update is useless one. Whom we don't want to follow either are being showing there to follow as there are some channels showing there. It should have been separated from status list. I hate using WhatsApp onwards. Now there is no difference between other platforms and WhatsApp.
1,"Good day, please this new WhatsApp isn't a good idea. The ""search Icon"" under status has been removed, why did you people have to remove it and secondly you can select your own status, you will have to view all over to get to your last post. This new features wasn't necessary, please. Bring back the old WhatsApp features. Thanks."
2,Need following features: 1. Allow/block messages from merchant accounts. 2. Mute all messages from the merchant accounts and unknown numbers. 3. Mute/block all incoming calls from the unknown numbers. In recent days all the spammers are communicating through whatsapp. There is no way to block them since every second they message from different number or merchant account.
1,Does everything a messaging app should EXCEPT there is no copy and paste. Major functionality shortfall. Every app on my samsung phone does copy/paste except Whatsapp. Maybe someday this function will be added? In the meantime Signal has copy/paste making it a good alternative that is fully functional.
1,"Don't know what you've done to this app lately but the UI is all over the place, responsiveness is well down and the new emoji system is annoying to use, was better before you changed it. Last couple of updates have really downgraded this app's quality and performance üòí"
3,"The app was been good so far but this new Emoji/Gif/Sticker interface is honestly terrible. I have to scroll through everysingle sticker or emoji just to look for 1 specific one. Swap the buttons back to their original format.Or atleast make it an option so those that like the new way can keep it like that, where those that prefer the old way i use it. Thank you"
1,"After the last update, the window that opens using stickers, smiley button become very annoying. Sometimes it opens only for the half row, and you can't see even 1 row of stickers, and most of the time it opens for the full screen and you can't see the chat. Please do something with it"
1,"New updated version is horrible, what is this channels for its doesn't even make sense as I can't even see statuses like I use to and it's so annoying. Is there no way where I can hide this channel updates nonsense!!!! Or better yet bring back the previous version, this is a total downgrade"
1,"The new update, with the channel and landscape status updates thingy is garbage. Y'all have to be really out of ideas to think this is progress. It's total garbage. It's stressful to even think about, let alone use it. Pls change it. It's WhatsApp, not WtfApp! Thank you"
2,"The channels update is too distracting mainy to students who quit all other social media app leaving WhatsApp(for common use and be in touch with institute/school groups ) . The channels feature is good cause any update brought by your team is thankful for all users as whole but one should also get the feature to turn it off and prevent the distractions . Please work on this,don't make your app away from touch of students. Expecting a appreciating response/update from WhatsApp. Thankyou"
1,The app is trash. At least for me. I've tried to change the number so I don't have to use my personal number for security reasons but the app will not let me. I've tried 5 different text apps and it won't except any of them even tho the site says different. Sorry whatsapp but I'm not giving out my personal number to every person out there.
4,"A bad feature of WhatsApp call is, it keeps making the ring sound even though the other person is not online. This can be very confusing sometimes. Other than that, it's good."
1,"Good morning kindly assist as am unable to retrieve my WhatsApp two-step verification pin, which I have been trying for the past two days. Due to this issue I cannot open my WhatsApp platform. I have tried In so may ways but I did no trecieve it. Yes I forgot the pin I used, but i pressed on forgot pin so that I can get code to log in and off the two step verification but I didn't receive it up till now both via email and sms couple with the fact am still using the same number and email , pls"
2,"Please return the Stickers Page as it was before. Each option (Last used, Favorites, Sticker's Packs) had their own page and it was faster to find and use them; now they all are in the same page and you have to scroll a lot to find them, even when trying to select an option like Last Used the app will charge for a while because of the scrolling"
1,"I am concerned that the Channel"" sercices you've introduced here are of no use to WhatsApp users. For instance, I use WhatsApp to connect with friends, family, and loved ones. The presence of state-owned media and corporate interests in the form of these ""Channels"" is very disturbing to me and many others who use your app. Please remove the Channels from WhatsApp."
1,"Not a fan of this new update with the channels and stuff. Can whatsapp please remain just an instant messaging app. All this other nonsense is not necessary. If it's not broken, do not fix it. The one star is for all these unwelcome changes, overall a great app."
1,"After the last update, my status posts doesn't share to my Facebook status anymore, what could be the problem? I've been trying my best and looking out for a way to connect to sharing my uploads to my facebook story,but to no avail.......Pls can I go back to the formal one? Cus I'm not fine at all with this new updated version! Thank u"
2,"This app has been so great until the recent update. The UI is very nasty especially that channels and status section. Why would you do such no option to search for status, no time to see when someone posted. What the actual hell. Na you guys have to fix this or revert back to previous update. You mustnt be like other social platforms."
2,I absolutely not satisfied with new updates ...i think there is a problem that i am not getting new features of video recording nd sending status in HD high resolutions..i updated my app twice than reinstalled whatsapp but it doesn't work at all ..All of my other friends are enjoying new features nd i am just hoping to get them as soon as i can..
2,"Needs new update, keeps showing the craziest things and it's not efficiently playing voice-mail for the past 2 weeks maybe. Keeps jumping from speaker to on ear speaker or won't play at all. Love whatsapp, but right now it's not that great. Sorry guys"
3,whatsapp has always been a great app but recently I have two issues. my media doesn't display on my gallery even after using android 11 migration so if I want to see any media I need to go to my files. secondly the new sticker tray is full of bugs. the pop-up is slow and when using it there are lots of faults. please fix this or make an option to keep the classic sticker tray instead of the new one
1,"whatsapp application is crashing again and again. There is only one solution to this, uninstall the application and install it again from the Play Store, then it comes back to its performance, otherwise it keeps getting crushed like this. Our biggest loss is that we are losing data and most important thing is data  in any phone."
5,"WhatsApp is a part of our phone system that can't be removed. I love it. But whatsapp can be even better if it can remind us to give status on our each close friends or relatives birthday on the basis of last year status record, slightly similar to Facebook birthday wish reminder. I may not be correct here because if it does work like that then there will be no special feelings involved and hence the birthday girl/ boy would not feel that great. Think about it and find a solution. üíñ"
3,This app is ok. It was not that good at any time at best it was an average app. Not because of its functionality it collects a lot of data sometimes its useful but mostly no and the quality of the pics shared on this app are so bad that even a pic taken in an iPhone or Samsung looks like it's taken on a budget phone and the video calls need a lot of data there is a lot of latency in them and hardly it will be good
5,"10 June 2023 The application is truly impressive, yet despite its abundance of features, it disappointingly lacks the functionality to export multiple files. When I receive numerous documents or images that require sharing in different apps or saving in goole drive, I am left with no choice but to save them individually and then attach/save each one separately. I kindly request your attention to this matter, as it would greatly enhance the user experience. Thank you for your consideration. 23,43"
2,"It's worse then ever after the latest update I completely lost WhatsApp it glitches I get no messages even though my contacts send messages, I can't send messages no one can view my status it's a mess WhatsApp I'd like if you consider this and check the problem cause it's a disaster."
5,"A suggestion if I may. I would like for users to know when another user is online by displaying that small, green-filled-in circle on the active user's profile picture (perhaps on the lower-right, just like on Facebook). How the circle behaves when a user if offline is up to you. You can either have the circle disappear completely, or, have it remain, but change color to perhaps red or black. Perhaps you can also remove the ""online"" function and have only the ""last seen"" function remain..."
5,"WhatsApp is a remarkable messaging application that has transformed the way we communicate in the digital age WhatsApp has truly revolutionized the world of instant messaging and communication. It stands out as a shining example of how technology can bring people closer together, regardless of geographical boundaries. There are several reasons why WhatsApp deserves such high praise. **1. User-Friendly Interface:** WhatsApp boasts an intuitive and user-friendl"
1,This app has been working perfectly fine for years until now it has said that I cannot download any files due to lack of space but I have almost 100gb of storage left. It was become very difficult to use and won't back up any of my chats. I've checked setting both ony phone and on WhatsApp and I carnt find the root of the problem. I am incredibly confused and would recommend finding a better messagaing app.
1,"This app is really frustrating with the android to iPhone transfer. It says it sends a code but doesn't and when I request a new one, it keeps locking me out. I'm now locked out for 24hours and can't get my content transferred. Thanks a lot."
3,"It's essential to add the following feature since this app is used in both personal and professional cases. Create folder or categories - I'm sure it's not just me but most of user must be finding it difficult to manage chats. - for my use case it become frustrating to find a specific chat window. - Yes, search function is useful but not when you have 50 chat widows open and you have to send a text quickly."
2,"I used to really like this App because it is a nice alternitive to texting, what I don't like is all the new stuff that keeps getting added ever since facebook bought whatsapp. It feels like they're turning it into a worse version of discord but in green. Whatsapp isn't supposed to be a social media app, it's a texting app. I don't mind the status that much but then the communities and now the channels? It's clear what the intentions are and I don't like it..."
1,"It's concerning to observe that the design team appears to be making changes to various sections of the app without a clear purpose or direction. The recent alterations to the stickers, emoji, and GIF sections, in particular, have raised some serious usability concerns. Placing sticker packs below the favorites is soo worst(takes time to scroll down for the wanted pack. In older version we can find the items side by side).Design team please don't make the app worse with your unreasonable changes"
5,"I like using WhatsApp. It's easy and simple. I like the status feature, I like spamming updates there. But today changed when you put channels there and hide my friends status. I'm not interested in channels, please put them elsewhere. And my friends status, don't hide them. It's annoying and look weird. I like rewatching them. Also my status. I get bored easily and enjoyed looking back what I updated. But you remove that one feature where you can scroll through your updates. Have a nice day."
4,"One of the best ways to have an imessage like experience without the iPhone like price. However, there is still some issues that Meta should address. First, please let us send higher quality video. I don't know why, but the video options are only 720p and 480p. It's technically better than sending it via mms. But I feel like if we can connect to a wifi router. We should be able to send full 4k video straight to our friends ios or Android. There's more. But please try it."
4,"duh! how many users have actually asked for this change of UI? why do you need to change something that worked just fine for years and years, is beyond my understanding. App Design isnt about ""fancy new looks every month"" but user friendliness and intuitiveness while using the app - that scores quite high. Now the speed of ""creating a message"" is greatly compromised cause ""Someone"" felt the urge to play with app's interface. Good job you guys #byebyeintuitive #wheredidthisbuttongo!?"
3,"Good day, I really love the effort you guys are putting in the app, but I do not like the recent update. I'm not comfortable with this ‚Äúchannels"" on the platform. I feel it makes the app too chaotic. This is great app and it has its own unique qualities, please don't spoil it. Kind regards."
1,"Again the sticker tray is back to its worst UI, why are you changing the whole UI? Aslo, earlier when i used to swipe a message to reply, a keyboard pop-up would happen automatically. Now even that's stopped. Worst update!"
3,"WhatsApp.. please I'm writing this to know if there's a way it can be rectified. I followed some channels on WhatsApp following the update,and now I can't even view it nor can unfollow the channels if I want to. It's not loading up at all,and I sincerely regret updating my app now. Please kindly send anything that can be useful to me Thank you"
3,"I used to enjoy WhatsApp not until this update, I can no longer find the search button in the status section, and what's the use of this new channels? Even to check analytics of my status isn't what it used to be before. Please revert to your old style, this new style isn't working at all. Thank you. even"
4,"The new function of WhatsApp is a very useful function to use the same WhatsApp on four mobile phones, but it seems to be missing a little bit, which would be great if it is correct. The same WhatsApp is used, the status option should be included in all of the original mobiles, so that those who want to set the status can use any of these four mobiles, thanks."
1,"This new version of whatsapp with channel is unnecessary, we already have that on telegram. Whatsapp was spontaneous, loved the video voice note that was a really cool feature, because of channels is now gone. Please bring it back, bring the video voice note back for it remove the channels."
1,Worst update ever. There is no need to add channels. Adding channel is so useless. Its not of any use. Just covering up the screen. And making it more bulky. Its getting worse with channels.
1,"I can't No longer send videos from my device to status or chats. It cant be sent if the video is Cutted in the whatsapp. It just said ""cant send this video, choose a different video and try again"" tried everything anf the issues still there. Asking us to send another video is just stupid. This is the video i HAVE to send. If it doesnt work, then, its the apps problem."
4,"Previously when I used to delete a message from a chat, whatsapp automatically use to resort the chat list according to date. but now when I delete a message, it does not change the chat list by date. For example, if someone messaged me last month and then again today, if I delete todays message, his chat will not move down to last month. In fact, it will remain on top of the list with last month date on the right."
1,"can you please sort out your Desktop app in the Microsoft Store, its completely screwed up, its stuck in a continuous loop of updating itself on windows 10/11 in its current implementation its absolutely useless, never had this issue when it was a standalone download, please fix this before I give up on this amd move permanently to Signal..."
2,"It is very irritating that WhatsApp on Samsung A53 doesn't have the functionality for incoming calls to pop up on screen nor to light up on the locked screen. Now when I receive a WhatsApp call the screen stays locked and black, so I have to unlock screen, pull down notifications screen, find the call among all other notifications, click on the call notification, then I can swipe to answer, by which time I've missed the call."
4,"Nice Front-end, User-friendly, Suitable for all ages... The app is one of the best messaging apps. Apart from the fact that some hands are trynna exclude the end-to-end encryption, inorder to better control us,.. The app itself is cool."
2,"Used to rated 5 stars before. We now can't even search for someone's status whenever we missed their status. Got hundreds of contacts to search 1by1. This is all because of the useless channels zone. It's so useless. We can just follow channels on other apps such as telegram and youtube. Whatsapp nowdays isn't same as before. The previous version was much better and easier.. Not only me, but many people already gave feedbacks abt it. What is wrong with you whatsapp team?!!"
1,After the latest update on. My keyboard layout has changed. Cant get it back. The search and emoji selection is on top and not at bottom. Its aweful.. Please fix this Its buggy... need to get the layout to the original. Original is always the best
4,"This app is good but the only problem is that both voice and video call habe some issues so will urge the org. to find solution to the problem. Also in gbwhatsapp, there is a fantastic thing there, *deleted messages can be seen* but in whatsapp messanger, it can't be But i still love the app because it ease messages and calls Thank you very much team meta"
3,"When on the GIF page, scrolling down causes the screen to go white, forcing you to only use the first 4-or-so GIFS at the top. When typing, a white space will appear and block out most of the screen. Please fix these problems."
4,The new feature channel is good but When the status is appear in vertical view is not convenient as well as previous users . Status will get as horizontal list .. This will be a problem where we follow a channel . If you don't follow a channel this issue will not ....
1,Stop messing up the UI. In the updates tab I don't want to see the Channels section. I know you want me to spend my entire life in meta apps but It really looks dumb to show the Channels even when I am not subscribing to any of them. The least you could do is make the Channels collapse able just like the View Updates is collapse able.
5,"As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, WhatsApp Messenger was a popular instant messaging application owned by Facebook (now Meta Platforms, Inc.). It allowed users to send text messages, make voice and video calls, share media files, and create group chats. Please note that there might have been updates or changes to the app since then. Here's a general review of WhatsApp Messenger based on its features up to September 2021: Pros: User-Friendly Interface:"
4,"WhatsApp has been a great messaging app, private and exclusive to people you give your number to/ to people whose number you save, but it's slowly turning into every other social media app. What's with the channels update? Give us the option to activate or not because I definitely do not want it....."
3,"I don't really like the new whatsApp update. The search option is removed from the status section and replaced by updates. If possible please return the status search option, it's hard to find others' status when we have a lot of contacts"
1,"I have been having issue of unable to log in to my WhatsApp Account close to a week now. But, this morning I received pop-up message to use the original WhatsApp and I followed the link that brought me here. Whenever I click on WhatsApp app on this page, it took me back to the same problem and it becomes a circular movement. Find solution to it please."
1,"During a call, people are not able to hear me half the time. I also have to speak really loud sometimes for them to hear me. Also sometimes during a call, the app will cut someone out and make it so that nobody can hear them."
3,"Over all the app is good and it's getting better with the new features. If we talk about app security or privacy then it lacks the main security feature that is still not included in both the main app & newly added chat lock feature. We can only lock an app or a chat with a fingerprint but for added security, the pin/password protection must be enabled so anyone having an issue applying a fingerprint can use an alternate security feature. Pin/password protection is the basic security feature."
1,Support is incredibly useless. The copy and paste replies really did it for me. Don't understand why they couldn't understand that I wasn't receiving a code because one wasn't being sent. Every time I requested one the app would respond with an error saying it couldn't. I was then told to do the call me option which I explained many times also wasn't working for me.
1,"While on chat, the interface on the emoji/sticker/gif emoji has changed. It's actually pretty terrible now - while typing a message, if I open the menu, it's much larger than my keyboard, and sometimes even hides the typing bar. Sometimes, it makes my keyboard disappear, and most times, when I select an emoji, it just randomly closes the menu. There are also horrible scaling issues (menu is much larger than the keyboard, so looks horrible) This is terrible - please revert back."
1,"The updated emoji and sticker layout is a step back, literally less intuitive as when scrolling through emojis you'll look through many types of them and they're easier for the fingers when in the middle of the screen. When at the bottom you press the side for emojis once and fiddle at the bottom of the screen which isn't ergonomic at all. The idea is good but I and many other users don't like it so when implementing new features , maybe don't remove the old ones and let us choose the best one."
1,The new update's voice messaging is a disaster. I can't play any voice note without clicking several times or clicking on other voice notes before I can play the required one! Please fix it!!!!
1,"Everything was good , but then WhatsApp add find channels option , we can't disable it , Facebook ruins everything what it touches , I start using WhatsApp because it was simple but they want us to use mobile phone evertime , I deleted FB and insta because of it , now I will delete WhatsApp also if WhatsApp will not provide any good option to disable it and keep away from the screen , I don't want that option anywhere on screen . Me and my friends will delete it if u will not give hide option."
2,"Since the latest update, I have an issue listening to the voice messages. As soon as I press play, my screen goes black and blocks itself. It is very annoying."
5,"The best app to now, but the latest security features have been introduced a bit late. The team needs to work diligently to bring new features earlier then later. Thank you team. And btw WhatsApp is now my primary and basic communications tool/app for staying connected to my family, friends and colleagues."
1,Dont bother update this app. Everytime they come up with something worst. These emojis keyboard changes are totally messed up as one is already used to tap on specific spots. Accidentally sent so many unwanted emojis and letters. Please keep to your old self you already have the most users!
4,"There should be an option for hiding suggestions for follow anyone or any channels. If I don't like the suggestions in update section then I could cancel the suggestions. Also in Status update of a video, the max video length should increase from 30 seconds to 1 minute."
3,"I love using Whatsapp and I love it. But I just discovered that the recent update have remove the search icon that we fine at the status side. Please it's a lot of stress having to drag all the way down to find a status I have already viewed. Please bring back the search icon on the status side to make life easy for us, Thanks."
4,"Good evening...For me everything is good expect for my channels I can't see what they've just sent, if I click on them they just keep loading and nothing happens and I don't think it my phone ""Tecno Spark 7"" because I even restarted it but with the same results."
5,"This a very good communication app we communicate, send message privately, or we can also see our friends, family through video call feature in this app. I recommend everyone that if you want privacy you can download this app(whatsapp) . There are now many new feature on this app like locking the chats, screen shot blocking at view once etc. We can use the latest version of this app. Thank you"
2,"Throughly dislike this new update about channels. Couldn't you guys slot it in somewhere else? Why is it that I have to go through my status one by one to delete something, I prefer the old interface. And isn't whatsapp supposed to be more personal than the other apps?? Why do we even need channels?"
3,"Not bad, but two issues, when viewing media on a chat, it combines all the media files whether sent or received, I feel it should be separated, also the status upload is terrible, it allows you write more than it can contain and when u upload it, you see half of what u have written is not there, also video trim for status is not good, u can trim 30seconds out of a 1 minute video and it will upload a different 30 secs from what u selected"
4,Feels irritated while updating status... Whenever I want to update my status.. i have to go though all photos and videos to search what I want to upload. There should be option to browse and select a particular photo or videos... ‚òπÔ∏è
3,"Hi developer. I really enjoy using WhatsApp in daily use. It simple, fast, and efficient. Sorry to say this, but i don't really like to make video status on WhatsApp, cause it get compress and the quality is totally bad. I hope you can fix the video quality of WhatsApp's status. Thank you"
1,"Worst app ever. I uninstalled it by mistake and after reinstalling it, realised that the local backup is literally of no use. I've tried numerous methods to retrieve all my data but all in vain. Is there any other option through which I can retrieve all my messages from the past 4 years if I didn't have them backed up on Google drive?"
3,I've been using this app for years now.. But loosing quality after uploading status is really one of the main issues I've with this app. When you upload a good quality video or photo on your status it really makes it in the worst quality possible. That's one of the main reasons I don't upload whatsApp status often. I hope the team would do something with that.
1,"The UI update is absolutely horrendous! Especially for the layout with emojis, GIFs and stickers. Either change it back to normal or at the very least add an option to disable the new UI layout. Who would approve such a stupid decision. On top of that some of my sticker packs no longer show up in WhatsApp,even after I re-add them"
1,My status is shown offline even though I am online. I am texting and it's been sent to them but not shown double ticks to me plus I can't receive messages from others even they are texting me. Worst app ever. Deleted the app and lost my entire data. And now neither can I receive data nor I have the previous saved one. WhatsApp should do something.
4,"Hi, I would like to provide feedback on the WhatsApp sticker menu. The new look is too complicated and not comfortable to use. I prefer the old sticker menu look, which is simpler and easier to use. Please consider returning the WhatsApp sticker menu to its original form. Thanks"
3,I was able to watch videos on browser such as chrome during whatsapp calls using Samsung Galaxy S7. But now the video pauses during whatsapp calls on my S10+. If i repeatedly push the play button on videos it will play a frame bit by bit. The only way to play smoothly is if I use a proper headsets with a stop/play button and at the video screen i hit the stop/play button once it will make the video runs smoothly during whatsapp calls. Is there any other solution to this?
1,"Hi, we need more features in the application, features like changing the nature of the background ie (this includes putting photos as backgrounds), calligraphy ie this is changing the style of letters, saving statuses while viewing them and also separating chats from groups. Thanks"
2,"I have been enjoying this app for a long time until this new sudden update. It's not working well at all, it keep bouncing when tapping to send messages and sometimes suddenly hang and would return you back. I first thought it was my android phone that was outdated until I found out it is this new version of whatsapp. Pls, kindly do something to it."
1,"buttons won't come up during calls. speakerphone randomly doesn't activate. video interface when phone is folded is SO stupid. video stability when rotating phones is unbelievably bad. one bonus star for not telling EVERYONE when I am online üôÑ BOSNUS STAR LOST because now I have to change media to full quality EVERY send, not just in the menu. garbage"
2,"I want to talk about the green bar at the top of the screen in the chat page/screen, the one that has the call and video call option, well it looks a little bland and there's a contrast with the wallpaper of the chat that just makes it look weird, a blur to replace that would look alot better imo, also make dark mode on whatsapp pure black not whatever that ugly colour is, or atleast give the option so people can select the color of dark mode they prefer, I hope you guys consider my suggestion"
1,"Each update is worse than the previous one. The app is getting worse.üò†üò† Why do you remove the three dots which shows the timeline of my own status?!! Also, the emoji keyboard is horrible when I try to insert an emoji my own message disappears from the screen and the emoji is inserted between the words !!! Please fix these annoying things üò° How to stop the vibration while making a react? üôÑüôÑüôÑ. It's very annoying üò° After the latest update, the top screen notification isn't working correctly."
1,"New update is more annoying than most apps. It glitches, the new emoji/sticker bar doesn't work properly, and sometimes closes by itself. Also, the record button/switch to video call gets stuck. Please sort this out. From a great app to the worst"
3,"I recently uninstalled the app for some reasons and installed it again after a little while and now in been trying to set it up but it isn't working it keeps saying ""unable to connect"" whenever it gets to the last stage of set up. Please I'd be really grateful if something was done to fix this"
2,"I have been using this app for 3 years now, pretty much good but I CAN'T SEE THE NEW MESSEGES SINCE TODAY MORNING, NOR MY TEXTS ARE SHOWING DOUBLE TICKS... I have asked my friends, and they said that they're not facing any problems. I have tried everything since morning, network on-off, airplane mode, clearing cache but it still isn't working... It would be great hell if you guys can tell me ahout it, since I have exams from tomorrow it's really is hectic without being able to use my groups"
4,"Have been using Whatsapp since it first launched and always been very happy. No i see with all the ""improvements"" it has a tendency to stop using Wifi. It keeps reverting to mobile data whilst there is excellent wifi available, both home and office. All other apps use same wifi with no issues, only the new improved meta has issues with a perfectly functional wifi availability? Any solution??"
2,"Why after updating, the message notification tone only lasts for 5 seconds? Not like before. I hope this can be fixed and returned to the way it was before. That 5 second message notification tone just isn't worth it. It is better to match the length of the ringtone."
1,There are lots of bug in new update 1) Message sending button is not showing but voice and video record button is showing intead. 2) the search box of my WhatsApp is not working properly and not searching any thing. 3) the tag button in any group not working. Please fix these issues as soon as possible.
5,"This app is amazing for keeping up with calls & texts, I don't have many problems with it! I would however suggest adding personalisation, such as being able to colour the current green theme to a selection of colours? But overall, the app is really good!"
5,"Can we just choose the color for the status background the way we do it in Canva or Microsoft Office? I don't know what it's called. Kinda frustrating and time-consuming to circulate the color before we write status. Because sometimes the color's just too bright, making the plain-white-font look melting into the background.... Many WhatsApp users use WA status to promote their business. With the right color, comes the right, suitable vibe and nuance for the product promoted."
5,"Excellent application. Dear developers, could you please add an option so we could mute certain contact, for example works colleague from for example 6pm till 7am everyday incl. Sat and Sunday. And some other contacts or groups, for other days and times... just had a message from colleague and it was 20 to midnight. Though about this idea... Mute certain contacts/groups, for certain days and times. Thank you very much for this app üôå"
4,Please bring back the old sticker selection menu! All the stickers scrolling past when you select a pack is unnecessary and could be uncomfortable and bothersome for people with sensory issues. It also makes it harder to find stickers and emojis.
3,App is stable and does its job perfectly. I only deducted two stars because Im getting tired of the same interface that we had for years now. Barely nothing new is added to the app. Hopefully we get to see some redesign in the future because it has been the same app for years now.
2,"Thank you for providing the chat lock feature, but there are still some shortcomings. Why is it that when I lock a chat in the application, the same chat is still visible on WhatsApp web? Also, when I archive the locked chat, the application displays the chat that I have already locked. Please fix this issue as soon as possible. the widget keep disappearing. please fix"
1,I didn't like the backup feature. I lost all the chats when I tried to transfer the chats to the new phone. I would recommend the old backup method. Looks like the new feature is released without proper testing.
1,I'm not showing Photo upload quality option under settings>storage and data. I have updated and seen. I have reinstalled the app. Still the option is not there. I stopped posting status in WhatsApp. It is ruining the images and videos. Worst app.
3,"It's been two months that I am lagging in Video call, it's not about my network strength but whenever I do video call it displays ""poor network connection"". Do something about it!! The video call quality is getting worse."
1,"Hi Team, I have been using Whatsapp for quite some time, however from the past 45 days I've been getting error you need the official whatsapp to use this account problem in android mobile while opening Whatsapp. After reinstallation, when I enter Mobile# for verification immediately getting the same error. I'm not using any other versions of Whatsapp to get dis msg. Have sent multiple emails to look into d issue but getting only automated emails without any helpful information to fix d issue."
5,"It's great being at what's app. Earlier there was this edit option for contacts, from where you can directly delete the contact, which is no longer there. Now that's causing inconvenience, please do something about it."
5,"Great app, I'm thrilled with the updates and features raining down every time. I think it would also be interesting to allow us to see the history of a message that has been modified, for reasons of traceability for us who use WhatsApp to work and exchange delicate messages"
1,Actually I am really upset about the video quality of this app . Why does the quality change when we send a status it's really really bad and i am disappointed !! I am hving regrets because i updated it . I hope you guys can fix this as soon as possible because it's such a hazard .. i can't upload a status videos with a text on it because text geta blury and it's such a disappointment . This app has been a really really good app but because of this problem it has become a total mess now .
5,"Easiest, default messaging app. Okay, it's not default, but you need to download it if you have a phone. I just think that there are some things that are pretty unnecessary. Like the broadcast thing. Like, I see no use for it. Ok, maybe I'm wrong, and it has a real use but it's pretty much the same thing as a group but does more. Then, there is announcements. Call me dumb, but there is no freaking use."
3,i think the recent feature which is been updated is not worth it. specially on status field. i am facing lot of issues in status i dont want to see any channel in status. i feel sometime that its not customer friendly. please let whatsapp only be for chat calls and status. same features we have in instagram fb and etc
1,"In the latest update version 2.23.18.79 dated 13-Sep-2023, it is showing ""Updates"" in place of ""Status"". When I clicked on ""Find Channels"", it showed me ""Agree and Continue"" for t&c. I did NOT click on ""Agree"" button. still it agreed automatically & now showing me different communities. I don't want to agree these t&c. Please let me know how to disagree to those communities t&c now. I don't want to join any communities & don't want to see it also."
2,"The new update has made chatting labourous, for people like me who use emojis and stickers a lot for expression. It's now more of a hassle to select stickers, as they're all in one place. Plus, whenever I want to select a sticker or an emoji now, the message hides away. Not cool."
1,"After the latest update whenever I am trying to send voice message my phone restarts and only after that I am able to send a voice message. Also, it is a recurring issue for each time I try to send a voice message."
1,"New update sucks. Now the status interface is changed into update and showing some public profiles. If I want to use the public profiles I will use other meta platforms. If you wanna stick with the public profiles follow on pages, please make it two seperate phases for that like status and update."
3,"Sometimes it's really irritating though, specially the latest updates. This latest updates of liking channels is very disturbing like an ads. Hope üôè this feature just just fades away in the next update version."
1,"Whoever coming up with these post- June 2023 updates needs to stop! -The latest update just dropped this app's user interface level. I had to rate it low. It's so frustrating now that I can't quickly just switch between emojis and text. You guys pushed the text box towards the top of the screen. That Channels section also seems unnecessary, I wish there was a way to disable or hide it. With every update, this app is becoming less and less friendly."
5,"It's a very nice app, simple to use. i always enjoy using it by video calling, voice chat and l messaging my family and friends. It's easy to use cause i can communicate with people as if we are together within the room, it's reliable, safe and amazing. I give it 5 stars though we are hoping for a feature to lock chats, not deleting the messages sent by someone and differenting group, personal chats, calls and status just like WhatsApp GB. PLEASE!"
1,"The amount local data stored is absolutely silly. Other applications like telegram have gone mostly cloud-based. This application is clunky and poorly designed. It is also owned by Facebook .. which means, you cannot trust them with your data."
1,"Stay up-to-date on topics that matter to you. Find channels to follow below. Even if it is a status to delete this latest update that has come to WhatsApp, it cannot be viewed properly, so either delete the update or put it somewhere else, it is a problem for us."
3,Everything looks good. But please I request the team to work on status. image or the video quality reduces a lot while uploading status. Its so sad that this one thing is not changing at all. Request the team to work on this and hope we get some update on this soon.
1,"I managed to give this app a one star ,make e no be like say person wicked because what in the name of app is this??! I'm a business person and I do lots of forwarding of messages and pictures from different groups to mine. Forwarding messages almost literally takes forever,it just rolls and roll till I have to cancel it. This is extremely annoying,it setsr back a lot. Call quality or lack of quality is another thing o and the stopping of the app for no reason at all Abeg make una look into it"
4,"Good to see that messages can now be edited, however, the way to edit is too long, make it easy by swiping left for editing messages, while swiping right for replying messages... looking forward for next update swiping left for editing"
5,"Hello.... Someone who isn't in my contacts plus whom i have had no interractions with viewed my status recently.... And as i do some reasearch, i heard he is using GB whatsapp. I hope this kind of incidents doesn't occur anymore as i much value my privacy. I really enjoy your app with my friends and families. Hope this problem is solved soon. Thank you."
1,"This ""Channel"" feature is a total bs and annoying. Nobody needs that. At least give an option to hide or remove it. The app was fine just as it was as a messaging app. We don't need another Facebook-like app. Facebook is terrible enough. Shame"
4,I really like the new Channel Feature that you guys just released. But I think you should improve the UI/ UX. Just show the channel list like the chat list and remove the Find channels section from the Updates tab. Thanks so much.
1,"After upgrading on the 31st August, I can no longer chat using the app. I can only communicate via video or voice calls. App keeps shutting down if I try to chat by typing. This is really frustrating"
1,"I don't like the new channels feature. I'd prefer it the app remains an instant messaging platform, this feature makes it feel like its social media... I don't wish to be served by unnecessary content."
3,Suddenly the status of my contact disappeared even though they haven't delete the status. Also the time of status suddenly changed. The status posted on around 10.53 pm but suddenly changed to 6.11 am. Kind of weird isn't it?? Please fix these.
1,"In my Google pixel 7 pro it was working well and all of sudden it said the account has been removed and asked me to enter the account information. When I entered the account information, all my chat history gone. Cant find or access any of my chat history and data. Now it's showing options to include channels. Seems whatsapp updated but removed the account information and history."
1,"Fix the problem of low quality of status as we are uploading a hd+video ,but when we can see the actual status the quality of video or images get low quality i highly request to firstly fix this issue according to my point of view and I hope in next update coming soon regarding the same status quality issues . Thankyou if you can solve the problem üôè."
5,"The is amazing, and I have been in a decade. But the last update messed the emoji and keyboard, and now I have to re-training myself. I'm constantly typing incorrectly since then."
2,Please do not turn whatsapp into something else. Its a mwssaging platform for the contacts that i have. Stories are fine but why include channels now. Seriously. Why??? Really not pleased with these updates and those reactions. Whatsapp was much better before when it was just about messaging audio calling and video calling.
1,"The new version doesn't have the muted status updates at handy You have to click the 3 dots on the right side, and there you find your updates on muted contacts . It's quite not fascinating on that part. It's too boring and lethargic."
1,I can't login. They didn't sent me SMS or call. (This review on 15/9/23) Today's 18/6/23 I can't get verification sms or call for 5 days. Every time Whatsapp want 1hr then trying. I sent e-mail several times for this issue. But Whatsapp didn't take any initiative. How disgusting! (Note: my device's okay. SIM active. Another Whatsapp do work. I used Whatsapp this device before)
1,"It's amazing I have been using WhatsApp for a long time, and it's my first choice for messaging and video call . I have noticed on thing which I thought I should give a suggestion about. suggestion.. If you send a someone and they give a reply on that message. The problem is if we go and edit they particular message on which we got a reply is still show the old message in reply highlight it would be amazing if WhatsApp change and update that hightlight too . regards"
3,"It would be silly to write a long review for WhatsApp as almost everyone in every country knows about it... So in short, the award for the best communication platform ever made goes to WhatsApp. It is amazing to see new and new features being added to it every month, while keeping the data end-to-end encrypted. The best thing (that no one talks) about it is that there are No Ads :)"
3,"Since the update keeps crashing in the middle of typing message. Never did that before. All the other extra bells n whistles stuff you add is just a distraction. I would prefer simpler. If we want that stuff telegram has it. I find it all very annoying. Also as another mentioned, would be nice to have the choice to send uncompressed images. Often the image quality is degraded and unusable. So then we are forced to send it in telegram or send anywhere.. Please make it possible to chose."
1,This app was famous and well-known for its simplicity. It was truly a instant messaging app. But day by day its getting worse and complicated. Just shifting from its real cause. This meta universe is ruining its platform. Please stop this unnecessary updates. Just keep it simple as it was.
1,When I long press on whatsapp icon in smartphone . It shows a list of frequently contacted friends. Without opening the whatsapp app. It is bad for privacy. How to avoid it. Please add a options to turn this option on or off. üòû
5,"User-Friendly Interface: WhatsApp has a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and find the features they need. Cross-Platform Compatibility: It is available for various platforms, including iOS, Android, and web browsers, allowing users to connect with friends and family across different devices seamlessly. Reliable Messaging: WhatsApp provides reliable messaging services, allowing users to send text messages, voice messages, photos, videos, documents, and make v"
2,"Since uodate with screen share, the video call quality, Is so poor, so pixlated.. tested another application, and it works great. If whatsapp does not fix this, I will Uninstal the application. Seems to get worse and worse."
1,"I reinstalled this app after unistalling it and kept getting prompted to ""use the official version of WhatsApp"". After contacting support and even recording a video of the problem all I get is a bunch of useless general responses. Really annoying when I had important messages I needed access to."
4,"WhatsApp is a recommendable default messaging app. however, I suggest that the call history be looked into because it doesn't give prompt and accurate records. also users should be able to send any audio to their statuses... another suggestion is that you separate group chats from normal DMS... just like you did for communities. the last suggestion is Very important please. it helps for better organisation. thank you so much for all you do at WhatsApp. well-done!"
1,"I just don't like the quality when uploading any videos or pics at status i feels very low resolution...& also timing length please make sure it should 1 min max.. just like Facebook gives us. It will be greatful if you give music adding option for status for us just like FB please, than I would give you a full Star.üôè‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2,"I uninstall and reinstall my WhatsApp. Then it ask for my old number phone verification, which is probably from my old friend's number. Just let me install it. I uninstall it because I accidentally hit clear all messages on a group, it's important i do not lose information on it. Then i see i cannot undo the action. So i try to uninstall and reinstall it again. Now it's giving me problems. Fix this"
1,"I am facing a very mysterious issue regarding microphone access in the background, even app is not in use. This happened not a single time but twice. I am very confused and disappointed at the same time."
3,"Needs to be provided with a log out option. Moreover, I hope there'd be an option that keeps my phone number hidden so that it won't appear in other people's contact list even after them adding my number in their phone book. That'd make me enjoy some privacy, keep irritating people away and decide on those I want to comtact via WhatsApp. Also, I wish there could be an option that could prevent others from calling us."
1,"Like all other social media apps now WhatsApp has decided to clutter the interface with channels of totally irrelevant people in the hopes to generate even more revenue than they were already making. At least put options in the settings to hide the extra features from our view based on our preferences, the whole point of messaging app is being destroyed."
2,Every update is upsetting. Why would you disable the list feature from the status bar? That Just makes things more difficult for us plus the calls have gotten worst. Their always disconnecting and hanging up by themselves.
2,"There is a problem in my app. When i have only WhatsApp pakage then it doesn't work properly. Status, pictures, stickers and videos take a very long time to download and send. When i have all net pakage then it works properly otherwise no. Please fix this problem."
2,"I have pixel 7 when I go to the contacts info page of any person and tap on any image that they sent or I sent them shown in the column and then go back to the contact info page again. The photo that I opened disappears from Media,Links and Docs column. I don't know why this happens. This does not happen in any other device is only happens on Pixel devices."
1,"I don't really appreciate the updated app. We no more have the opportunity to make research on the status page of the app. Moreover, the display of status looks like in Facebook, what is not interesting for me. The old version was better than this one."
1,The new features like changing status to updates and removing muted status from the list is very cheap updates And also adding channels in the status area is also annoying.. Why is this happening why whatsApp act like telegram? Make a saprate page or section for channels and remove the muted status option from 3dots.put muted status to back in position it's lot better than the updation. Because lot off us still watching the muted status of ex girlfriend we want know that thay put status.
2,The wear os version of this app is very disappointing. If I read a message on my phone it doesn't clear the notification on the watch. Also you can't reply quickly to a WhatsApp message on your watch. You first have to click a reply on watch or reply on phone link. It was almost better before the wear os app. If these issues aren't fixed I shall uninstall.
1,Facing many terrible issue after the latest update it is very horrible. Putting updates option on the place of status is not good. Don't make it instagram plz by updating it's feature.now Whtsapp became disgusting there is no option of removing channel. I can say it became a worst app now.they must know that whtsapp and instagram both are different app don't make them similar just make it simple as it was earlier. Don't make changes in it.dont make it instagram.
3,"can't play voice messages in WhatsApp, this problem just occurred since last week. i have to close the application and open it several times just to listen to one message then i have do it allover again and again."
5,"I loved most of the things in WhatsApp that one is status, messaging the way of communication we are using and if we don't need the message we can delete it we can change our dp profile then and one problem is that we cannot do video call before but right now it is good and voice call also."
3,"What's the use of this app if nobody is texting me , i don't even receive voice call , video call , chats . Nothing at all. What wrong with this app . When ever I text someone it becomes bule or double tick but I'm unable to receive a text back . Whenever I call someone it rings and turns declined . Such a useful tool for me ."
5,"It's good ... I was thinking that it would be better if we are able to group chats , like folders....I would appreciate single tick option too and also forward option without downloading."
5,Good...but lately...while forwarding messages...it goes on circling n circling...n takes 3 to 4 minutes to search a contact. Any remedy for this ? Did re-installed. It worked for few days. It became fast. But again takes time to search a contact while forwarding. Pls help....
1,Very Bad Experience. Its Support is very lazy and not response. Its about 2 month ago my account is block i provide everything for proof but still not resolve. Yestersday whatsapp block my 2nd number as well. I have no idea whats going on. And when i contact its support. There is no response. Very Disapointed.
2,"Being a data heavy app it is lacking the basic option to chance data location to SD card, Although other similar app provides this option. It will fill up your phone memory no matter how much space you have."
4,"Since about couple of weeks my whatsapp is malfunctioning for strange reasons, unable to receive or send messages, let alone talking or video chatting. Uninstalled & reinstalled (stays on for a few minutes) this app, nearly half a dozen times but without any success. I wonder if I should suspect my WA a/c is being hacked! A pop up appeared for half a second & I failed to take a screenshot. It goes on in Hindi (in English letters as well) like ""sura (or pura) fekna hai"". Can anyone help, please?"
3,"I've been very positive about WhatsApp for the most part, but recently the emoji and sticker keyboard have been redesigned and it's honestly horrible. The bar is way smaller and doesn't allow me to increase its size, making it impossible to properly view and navigate the stickers and emojis. Being someone who really likes to use these, this update honestly really impacted my enjoyment in using the app in a very negative way and I hope to see this issue fixed."
3,"the app is nice but this channel update is not it at all, I still prefer our normal status interface and now it's looking like you want to copy telegram which doesn't make sense, every social media has it own uniqueness, so don't ruin your unique purpose by trying to copy others."
2,"The update itself is just a downgrade on other features that were helpful in the app like the search button on the status tab. The emoji keyboard is now quite confusing I prefer the previous layout of the emoji keyboard. Too bad I can't use the previous version, coz I prefer it to this current version"
1,"I don't like this update. Where is the search icon for status updates? Pls return it. Why do I have to scroll down when I need to view particular people's updates. Also, when you need to add smileys to your text only status update, you have to scroll down. Pls arrange it in the manner it's easy to use."
5,I have a suggestion. There should be left swipe option or double tap etc. to edit sent text message . Because while chatting it takes time to select and go to edit option from top right corner.
2,"In my last review I asked why archived chats come out of archived when a new message comes. Finally addressed, but new problem with group chats. I have dozens of people in group chats and everyone uses audio messages instead of text, it uses so much memory. In the media n storage settings you can auto download media from all types of chats or nothing, why is that? Make a seperate option to auto download media from groupchat. I always what to be updated on family so auto download, but not in GCs."
5,"Two suggetions: 1. Limitation of ""PIN"" option should be at least for more than 5 to 10 contacts in chat window. 2.""Exit Group"" option should not be in ""More Tab"" very near to ""Clear Chat"" and ""Export Chat"". Accidently someone can click exit group and then confirm. It is already available in group info area at the end. So better at only at one place. Today a Soft Reminder. after 8 months."
1,"Bug, lagging while texting and typing, please fix. I prefer the old version no channel, with simple navigation. I found it hard to use emoji, sticker using latest navigation."
4,Amazing messaging app. It would be better if you add a feature that asks confirmation before sending a voice message as many times unnecessary voice messages are mistakenly sent.
1,"This is the worst update. Like why did you have to change anything? Whose idea was it to put channels? Stop copying. Let X be X, Instagram be Instagram, Facebook be Facebook and WhatsApp be WhatsApp. Imagine if cake tasted like cake and fish at the same time.... If it's not broken, don't fix it. Zero stars had it been possible for this update. Also can't see when people posted or what they posted before opening the post."
1,I know update is good but can you leave it as just messaging app its becoming social media with very updates... It doesn't feel like a messaging at all now and become very difficult to handle cause of appearance of community and ramdom people. It feels like invasion of privacy. It's becoming stupid app day by day messaging app doesn't need this much unnecessary features... Just privacy..
1,"I have seen the official's argument misleadingly claiming about privacy. Facebook ruins everything it touches. 2. i am frustrated with the inability to delete messages after their set time expires. 3. the images i want to attach takes a long, long, very long, very very long time to load previews to select the folder to look in to, to attach an image."
5,Whatsapp app is one of the best app we should say not it has also provided the option to send HD photos. But there is somthing that i want to suggest that is we get the option to enrich the document file in the app like camscanner or noteblock etc then it will make it best app for office use also.
1,"Whatsapp status (or now named as updates) is in so much worse state now. Now there is whatsapp status feature that shorten a video if u watched it once. Like why?? I just wanted to rewatch some of my friend's and my status video again and it just immediately cut the video especially if its more than 15 sec long. Plus whatsapp should extend the length of status video from 30s to 60s, 30s is always not enough for some posts. Also if u ever feel useless, remember that whatsapp channels exist lol"
1,"How can this keep getting worse and worse?? The keyboard and emoji interface is now basically unusable!! What is the UI team doing? College students design better UI than these people! Don't fix what isn't broke, keep it to stability updates! This is a shame, Whatsapp used to be so good, now it's just awful!!!"
1,I am unable to activate my account after the update. Some random person's picture is there on my account and she is also seeing all the messages sent to her. There is no resolution from whatsapp support except the Bot framed basic message. Please help team.
1,"Please give users the option to turn on/off this new feature of channels. I find it unnecessary for me. People will definitely put it to use but make it a choice. Some use WhatsApp for private/intimate things. If I want to keep up with celebs, I can do that on Instagram."
1,"Make Phone permission optional. Previous versions were able to make calls without it. Everything is E2EE or so you claim. Then why risking privacy by accessing phone permission. Let me bothered about phone calls or whatever. Don't force. Because once you force, means you have a personal/business advantage for sure."
2,"I don't like the update that when I press emojis, gif, or sticker, it need to swipe up manually to show them (the old one always show automatically) when my android navigation using swipe up to go home. So i give 2 star until this experience get better."
1,"The screen keeps going blank like when you put your phone to your ear, however it's not near my ear and I'm busy sending messages. All these problems after the update."
5,"We don't need any Channels! Please remove this changes Other wise This app is awesome and also first classüòéüëç.But the only problem is that if you upload a picture, its quality decreases, then its attractiveness also decreases, so please fix it... Thank youü§ì"
5,"WhatsApp is super!!! I have one suggestion though. Please can you make the voice chat feature available for large groups? Like up to 1,024 members for a good start? I'll love to use it for audio LIVE conferences and seminars. It's better than group calls. I LOVE WHATSAPP!!!"
1,"After i recently updated the app on my andriod, my messages wouldn't go through. The app is completely frozen on my phone and only notify me that "" you may have new messages"". Please do something about it immediately"
1,the latest update with the channels is very annoying also you can't delete several statues at one time you have to delete one by one which is very annoying as well. Please undo the update as it is very frustrating. Also I have auto update turned off and it's automatically updated!! That's violating my privacy as I chose to update when I want to and it's went ahead and updated itself!!!
3,Hi team WhatsApp This is Sunil from India üáÆüá≥ Facing an issue with audio mess. I mean to say when doing WhatsApp chat with someone it's ok but when I try to send a voice message; my device is restarting/ rebooting ü•∫ This is happening again and again. This problem may have happened after the Android's new updates ( Android 13 ) please help
1,After losing my Phone I blocked my Sim card and got a new Sim. After 24 hour cooling period my OTP's started. All apps started working but Whatsapp OTP is neither being received via SMS or call. Support is pathetic. I am getting the same rehashed mails. No solution whatsoever. Extremely painful experience. If someone is reading this please call me.
1,Where is the more ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ selection for status? That's an important feature. It allows me delete my status when I want to and allows me to review what I have post. How do I hide the channels at the bottom? I don't wish to see that when I am in whatsapp. I go to Facebook or some other app for that.
4,it's a good app but you can't delete contacts so i just have a bunch of useless contacts that i don't use what i mean by that is if u delete contacts on your phone it's still saved on whatsapp but it doesn't keep the name but if you accidentally do that you can recover the contact so it balances out also people have downloaded apps to find girlfriends on whatsapp and it's concerning that they can do that so maybe your privacy isn't very safe so be careful!! xx
1,Your app doesn't have a translator I shouldn't have the back out going through a bunch of stuff trying to set the Translator by pushing a copy but it should already be built into the app all translator should be built into the app weather in Spanish Chinese Portuguese it doesn't make a difference what language it is it should be built into the app and it should automatically pick it up we can do your applications when you do your app and re-fix all the critical errors
2,"Whenever I am starts taking backup of whatsapp, I am continously receiving error "" Backing up messages Please wait a moment. But faile$ to get backup. I have tried so many things like cleared cache, updated whatsapp, selected email account, selected cellular of backup, remove Including Video option, restarted so many times but still same problem"
3,I really don't like the channels update. It's unnecessary and not what the app is about. It's mainly communication. The worst part is their is no option to hide that menu.
1,"It's been a wonderful app to use not until this latest update Kindly put the keyboard back to what it was before I hate the fact that it keeps on adjusting rather resizing from emoji section to phone keyboard Just stick to what you had before, using the telegram keyboard isn't the way to go please act up on it and Kindly put back the chat and status icons back to normal they look ugly Kindly revise your updates before you putting them out for users"
3,"I give this 3 stars, because its brutally reduce the quality of photos or videos that you post at your story. Just bring back the option for choosing the quality of the photos or videos that we post. Thank you"
3,"The app is pretty good. But there is something that just absolutely ruins my experience with the app:I can't use stickers!! When i try to click on a stickers pack,it just won't work. I can't use my stickers now,and i am sad about that. Please,give me an answer or fix that! :("
1,"with your latest update I am feeling lot of problems, which needs to be addressed immediately... The big problem being faced in this regard is the absence of enter button which now changed in to send button, absultly un-understandable, please look in to the matter and resolve the matter immediately... Secondly my messages are not being sent and received at all since morning... Please guide me in this regard... Thanks with best regards"
5,"Hi Whatsapp, I've been using your app for 5yrs+ and I must commend you for the updates which shows how much you care about user experience. I would like to drop a review for a challenge I've been having with voice notes, is it possible to play/send it from the notification window of my device. Lastly I love the improvements and would like to be a tester for the too if that's possible. Appreciate the work you put in."
1,suppose i upload 4 videos in status and if i want to remove one of my status there is mo option for that. the new update is not worth for single star. Very worst update in the history of WhatsApp . PLEASE REMOVE IT ASAP. THE PREVIOUS VERSION IS FAR BETTER THAN THIS ONE. AND THE FOLLOW BUTTON WITH GREEN TICK MARK (are you trying to copy Twitter) then please don't do that. remove the follow function .all things makes it a 2nd copy of Twitter the previous old version is far far better.
1,"Worst User Interface so far. UI should make app easier to use, not the other way around. Now we can't even swipe to the left or right through different sticker packs, because it will send us to GIF or Emoji Section. Before Emojis were easily accessible during typing, but NOPE, not now, as the bar has been moved to lower section. Now Backspace button for emojis is also sent above..Like what?? Keep Emoji buttons and Backspace in allignment. Only due to these reasons WhatsApp has lost my respect."
3,Great app but i really hate the new update on status when i want to see someone's status these channels pop up even if i just don't want to follow the channels there is even no cross button to remove the channels screen from status and if you want to see it you can just click the zoom in button to see the channels these channels are really annoying when you want to see someone's status i am not getting used to it everyday new updates just annoy me more than helping me
1,I don't want to give even a single star but there's no option. After this recent update it's looking like sales software absolutely ridiculous. Update section should have to remove status one was the better than that. Update section looks like sponsered. It's absolutely worst version. Absolutely disappointed from this version.
1,Very bad experience from last 2 months. Getting video paused every minute on video call. I am facing this issue from last 2 months very much. Even updating the app is not solving it. Please check this issue and try to solve it for me.
1,Recent update sucks. App became very buggy and slow. Switching between GIF and Emoji tray tabs are not that smooth and great. Facebook ruined user interface of WhatsApp. You guys don't have to put useless features in this app it's just an messaging app don't try to make this a social media platform. Please keep everything simple just for convenience. Also disable the feature of auto playing GIFs because it is very annoying.
1,This app deserves no star at all. Recently WhatsApp updates have become really terrible.constant stopping of the app for few hours is really embarrassing.the hanging and too much lagging especially with the keyboard is a total mess.i wonder why the old versions seems to be better than the recent version whereas the reverse is supposed to be the case. I just hope our complaints are listened to and good modifications made to the app.
1,"You said that we could hide our chats without been noticed,that setting is not there on WhatsApp, I've been trying to locate it but I can't find it yet when you update your apps, the functions are not there, the archives on your latest update pops back up like the old versions of years back. Can you improve on that please"
4,Love all the new updates. Love the screensharing feature. But why not make the screensharing be able to share sound to? Because the screenaharing works great but would be even better if sound was also able to be shared.
1,Newest update is terrible. They are trying to turn whatsapp into another Instagram Facebook. The channels have no place on this platform. The least they can do is let you opt out. It's supposed to be a msg app with good security....
1,"With the latest update, the bar for emoji and stickers switched (up & down), making it a bit weird. However the worse part is when i use stickers, it doesnt show on my screen like it used to be, ending up i dont even know whether i have sent out or not. I cannot see what sticker or emoji i sent out. Really annoying ! Pls look into it and fix it!"
1,"Help.. My WhatsApp account is banned I have tried sending many other mails or even sending the code or number in full international format as requested but still there is no response, I am still worried. Please fix it as soon as possible No matter how much I try, after sending the mail I still get a reply in full international format, but I am unable to understand, my WhatsApp When will it be fixed? It was blocked without any meaning: Please fix my WhatsApp account quickly. please help me suppo"
5,"What I like about whatsapp is that it changed so much from it release.I remember the times when you could only use the app for messaging and phone call.Now-along with other features like status and stuff-you can do a lot more.I find especially helpful the abilities to react to and edit a massage.Not to mention the choice not to use ads. I mean after you see ads literally everywhere and in every app,you want at least to message people in piece."
1,"Not working properly, slow processing, slow loading every media file, taking so much longer time to download photos, videos and most importantly status. Sometimes if I'm sharing any file to someone it also take so long time."
5,Your privacy is really best but I want one more thing. Like when we send anything from gallery to WhatsApp specific person. And next time when we again something to WhatsApp. It shows recent persons who achieved our data. So I want to remove the icon of specific person who achieved my sending data. I hope you will consider it.
1,"I very rarely give bad reviews. you became slower, does not show all pics in gallery and on top of that That double messy voice/video message function, which was already there It lag the phone, it lag the camera and moreover, it defy the real use of WhatsApp (quick voice message app) There is no reason to copy other app, if we wanted to use line, WeChat,or Snapchat we would already been using it by now. You used to be so simple and easy to use, do not overcomplicate yourself. We don't need it"
1,"I recently switched from apple to samsung. I used to send my customer documents and images selecting all at once to my email. This is so much annoying in the android version of app. I can send single document in a email but when I select multiple document, the option to send these via email just vanishes. I just get option to forward over WhatsApp only. This is extremely annoying and extremely unhappy"
2,"This update was absolutely unnecessary and uncalled for Asides from the fact that I can't see my calls in real time, keyboard now drags, stickers and emoji arrangement is really annoying and tell me why I've not been able to send a voicenote since I updated the app? It keeps giving the flat line. I'm so pissed"
2,"WhatsApp has a biggest publicity in social media apps for its new updates and features. But this time of update I feel bad for WhatsApp.WhatsApp's old feature swipe to reply and open keyboard. But but not now. Now is the swipe to only reply but keyboard isn't open. For open keyboard tap on textbox ,so I don't like it. So I requested to developers of application please notice my experience and my mind and set this issue.And I very much like to that feature single tap on voice msg btn to video msg"
4,Privacy features are best. End to end encryption technology is by far very good. Only the thing that doesn't feels in place is the locked and archived chats that display on top of all the chats.It shouldn't be there as privacy concerns.It should only be found after searching or special protection feature enabling to hide the locked messages.
4,"This is very elegant to communicate easily, but recently the changes in emoji keyboard was crashing while switching to type or to find a sticker. Please fix this bug, we looking forward for your updates. Thanks WhatsApp team"
1,"The app just randomly logged me out and after logging back in, all my recent messages weren't loading and it was just showing ""Waiting for this message. This may take a while"". All the messages were visible about half an hour ago before the app decided to log me out. I contacted the support and didn't even get a response other than an automated reply. Absolutely horrible support. Will be sticking to telegram and signal from now."
1,"This app is getting even worse after each update , 1 - I can no more see the time when someone uploaded a status without opening it 2- scrolling through the status has become frustrating after the last update since scrolling down is much easier and comfortable than scrolling to the side. 3- the outer look of the status now is the profile pic of the poster , instead of the status itself , which is frustrating too , because now I have no idea about what is there before opening them all already."
2,"App was perfect until they changed the emoji/gif tray to be animated and removed the quick return to keyboard. Now I have to wait for the animation, select the emoji/gif, close the tray, wait for the animation to reach the bottom of the page, tap into the message box and wait for the keyboard to appear. It's so cumbersome to add emojis/gifs now and completely ruins the flow of typing."
5,"Very good and so much interesting features to add screen sharing on video call. Request you to please consider one thing :- in addition to screen sharing please add to control as (any desk, MS team) so that help full to resolve problem and it will be very easy to operate and help from long distance too."
4,"I really appreciate this app, seeing as there are millions in Morocco and other parts of the world who use WhatsApp as their main form of texting. However, could you please bring the text enlargement and the same background images that are available in the PC version to the mobile app? It would be nice to be able to use those settings in both app versions. Thank you!"
3,"All the features are awesome in tge app, conaidering it is a hassle to talk to someone in a different country.. Whatsapp makes it possible for you, without any extra charges.. If only the status time was increased, it would have been much better than now.. 30 seconds is too short sometimes for videos to post.."
5,"Heyy what'app I love using your app but I have one request can you bring up the next update like chat ""correction feature."" Describing this ""suppose you've texted something incorrect and you can't undo that action once blue tick appears, in the chat correction feature you can select that particular message , correct your mistakes and send it again to the deliver""."
5,I really love the new face recording feature....I can easily now know when my friend is being underhanded or scincere when voice recording and the security features for people you really don't want to relate with on the app is top notch. I really love whatsapp and how much the team is trying to make it more user friendly. Highly recommended.
4,"Removing one star. For some time, the most annoying behavior is the ""backup in progress"". The backup tile keeps on showing again and again above the other opened apps or the idle screen. There is no way to stop it and accidentally touching it takes you to open WhatsApp even if you don't will to."
4,"I am giving 4 stars because of some slight glitches both on WhatsApp and WhatsApp web. On WhatsApp, whenever I reply to a video status, the video keeps playing even after I've left the status bar. It only stops when the message is sent. Then, on WhatsApp web, I can't view up to 10 statuses at once. Once I view up to 3,4,5, or more status, the entire app would just go blank, and I have to refresh the site. Please fix the glitches üôå"
1,"Really hate the new sticker update. It makes no sense as to why it was updated in the first place, the old sticker update where the icons where on the bottom and each individual sticker pack was in its own folder made it so much more easier to use. Now it's just really confusing to tell which sticker pack is which because its now scroll instead of slide. Honestly what made you guys think this update was a good idea? :("
4,"The app works very well, but it could be better if there was an option for natively create and send a link to a file for many people and, if you've sent the wrong document, you just change the associated file. Then it wouldn't be necessary to delete the sent link for every single person."
3,"The latest update 3 days ago broke the keyboard and gif/emoji drawer. If I open a chat and without tapping in the text box, but click on the emoji button, the drawer opens fine. But if I tap on the text box and input text and tap on the emoji button to insert and emoji, the drawer kicks the text to the top almost out of view, has this huge black blank space and then the gif/emoji/stickers. Stupid!!! Fix it!"
3,"The new emoji keyboard/behavior could be used in a UI design course as an example of what NOT to do. - the text field disappears when emoji is selected - the height is different from normal keyboard so there is no button that *stays in the same position on screen* to switch between the two - why on earth it reverses back to text keyboard when I tap the text field? Please, roll this back."
4,Great app and very efficient to communicate with family and friends but.... After update I experienced 2 probkems. 1. Messages does not go through or recieve unless you are IN the app. 2. Content does not download in the background. Have to stay in app while downloading. Which is inconvenient when you work from home on your phone and need to use multiple apps.
1,I had bad experience with whatsapp. I was not able to send or receive messages. So I contacted support team they told me to delete the account and register again. They assured me everything will work. I have done the same. Now I am moved out all the groups and no chat history is seen. i have contacted them again and they told to reinstall whatsapp so the backup will be taken. I have done it and it is not recognising the backup. The end result is that I have lost all the valuable data.
4,"It's nice but the thing is that as the video call quality it's almost regretful since the options below will be gone in about 5 minutes and it can be irritating if you have to switch cameras frequently. It is 5 stars because of the best text quality and the call quality but the video call quality disappoints . Try to fix this issue cause it is affecting your rating. If it's fixed , you can get a 5 stars rating easily!"
4,"Absolutely good... One suggestion I want to put here is show some notification/ indication icon on the DP circle area showing when a person is on a audio/ video call... If a person is on a call, when we try to call them, WhatsApp doesn't give a call engage tone, so it is very difficult to know if that person is on a call or not... Put some ""ON A CALL"" icon near the DP area showing that particular person is on a call... Kindly consider..."
2,"My Android phone is having problem with this app even after I reset all settings of mobile. The mobile Gallery shows too much large size files in Documents folder. If I delete them, again they come. And pictures which I receive in WhatsApp are not showing in Gallery. What is the solution for this as I am really fed up. I wish I could add Screenshot here."
2,"Ummm... It's a good app, but.. Whenever my friends send photos or screenshots of things, the pictures enter my gallery without permission in the ""WhatsApp"" Section. It's really unnecessary and a bit creepy. If you know what's happening please reply. Thanks, cause' I don't know if I accidentally connected them =)"
1,"This app is not working properly at all. The email id for Backup was signed out itself & Backup wasn't working. The names of saved contacts are not visible & only phone numbers are showing. If i save the numbers again then later it will disappear again, leaving a new contact made in the contacts list of the already existing contacts in the phone. Restoring backup takes hours even if the internet connection is excellent. It was good till 2021 but now, very bad app experience. App has many bugs.üòï"
2,"Master of lagging, reducing media quality when uploading, stealing ideas from Telegram, and unexplained errors. Recently, whenever I upload a video on my status, it says ""Can't send this video. Choose a different video and try again"". Please atleast try to fix it. There are more bugs than actual features."
1,"What does it take to fix the damn video quality in status, user should have the flexibility to chose the quality in which they want to upload or send a video file. It's been under meta for years where Instagram has the option to upload in higest quality available though not original why can't this app have the feature for videos while recently it got the feature to upload high quality photos, it doesn't take that much for such basic feature to implement. Fix the god damn video quality."
1,"it was my favourite messaging app that i have been using for years until the recent update..the interface was awful and it doesn't flow smoothly while typing especially when you are used to the smooth old interface..its laggy as well !! i type fast, and when it is laggy, i often get the wrong emoji..i will need to delete and choose the right one again..pls return the old smooth surface..the new update is a failure !!"
5,"This app is very useful. We can send messages, we can send voice message, we can do video call also. Whatever you want to say to anyone, just type whatever you want to say and click ok that message will go to that person. There is one blue mark in the corner that is tick mark this symbol will show you that whatever you have sent to any person that person has seen your message or not. So according to me this app is very great ful for me."
2,Don't support sound mute via volume button so it rings until you turn off sound very annoying. On non Samsung devices have problems with file transfer don't recognises file extention. Changes file structure while sending without any asking or permittion and file is non usable afterwards. Have non handy gallery. It's getting worse by every update. I'm affraid what's gonna be next new option.
3,"I've been using this app for a long time and it's works really well on the phone. I just recently downloaded it to my Galaxy watch, particularly on my new Galaxy watch 6 classic and it seems to be the biggest battery drainer out of any of the apps installed. Although the app works fine, it needs some optimization as it is currently using approximately 6% of my watch battery, more than any other app on the watch."
1,"Latest update changed the menu for emojis. It now expands to becomes larger than the keyboard when pressing the menu option. This shifts the button to change back to typing to a different place on screen. Also, if some text has already been typed, the emoji menu now covers your text and changes the method to close the emote menu. Since using emojis is an integral aspect of communication with the app, this update impacts the ease of use to such an extent that it deserves this low rating."
1,"Please whatsapp allow storage on SD disk. I've had to switch many of my friends to Telegram app because it allows the option to store on external storage, like an SD disk. Although the app is good to use, it eats up storage memory and slows my phone. I lost over several apps I had to uninstall just to update and what'sapp would not run in the old version it made me update. Had I been using my old phone I would have had to stop using what'sapp."
4,Back to great again! The change 20/7/23 moving emoji category menu from above the emojis to below broke my access to emojis. It's now back to how it was. Thanks. 4 stars-I'd like a 'delete sent images/videos' per recipient between 2 dates to reduce memory use - my 'sent' media is already stored elsewhere on my phone. A function to set how many days of backup are stored(big files) and a batch send function eg I can type 6 messages then press send to avoid getting into a live chat after message 1
1,"I have'nt seen any worst, disgusting and useless app than this app for voice and video calling. I wish I could give this app zero stars. Whenever I try to call anyone it started showing reconnecting problem afterwards other person stops hearing my voice after few minutes. I don't know any reason why people are using dumb app for texting and calling. They keeps on updating this app no doubt but they are not able to solve single problem."
4,"Wow! Wow! Wow!üíÉüíÉ The new WhatsApp update is superb! But I wish that the chat lock won't be hard and that the settings are in the app. Cause I am finding it difficult to chat Lock and also styling my text shouldn't be stressful..I mean I can't be typing and selecting my front style Everytime..I wish that the front styling settings could be permanent to avoid doing the same thing over and over again üòÅ thank you..but above all, the new update Is a job well done!"
1,"Grateful for whatsapp but since last update, too many lags and bugging. Was used to stickers being in a certain place, now it's all messed up and instead of clicking on backspace, i'd be clicking on another emoji üôÑ plus typing bar is larger than should be and covers part of chat. And stickers delay in appearing. I want my previous version back!!! üò¢"
4,Love Whatsapp but recently have to downgrade becuzwith past two updates I can't respond from notification drawer/pull-down menu any more. If I do it just hangs/spins. If i open app after i try sending from notification drawer I lose the message completely. This means i have to open the app each time i reply. Very inconvenient. Other than this issue happy they added an OS app.
4,"My dates are completely wrong. The date seems to begin with April 21st, 2008, and all of my dates are 38? Also, chats do not arrive in order as before. They might show up at the top, or they might suddenly drop to the bottom. It's a bit confusing. I have searched online, but so far, I have been unable to get it corrected despite following the various instructions. I hope you can help me. Thanks!"
1,Every time there is a new update. It comes with a nonsense updated version. Keyboard no longer pops up I have to navigate so it pops up. Sending an image is absolutely nonsense when it takes time to load and it did not do this before. The keyboard is also appalling.
3,"The app's pretty good overall, except for one; the images' quality. The quality is so bad that I couldn't see the image properly. The texts in some images are blurry and it's difficult to read, which is pretty awful. Please fix its quality, thank you"
1,"1. Moving between phones causes error 2. Backups don't do anything since when you log in again, this app instead of downloading backup overwrites it deleting only ducking copy, because this dumm app doesn't allow you to create more Not even mentioning that you can't restore backups with a freaking button because apparently that is too complicated for those developers to program. This sucks in many areas, but those are the one in which the biggest consequences"
2,"the latest version update is getting worse. if we upload a video in status the quality drops and becomes very bad, it compresses a lot even though the file is not big (around 3mb). whereas the previous version, a little better. please fix, it sucks to see the quality uploads get so bad. thanks."
1,"This app is getting worse and worse every time... I wish all my contacts use another one. This app is for text messages, not a social media. The new option for temporary pic is awful, I pressed so many times by mistake, please, at least add an option to deactivate it."
5,"I liked latest feature where we can record voice and keep it as a status. But i would like to suggest one more thing. User should be able keep other audio files also as their status. Now, my friend is singer, he sings really good and i can't share it with my connections by keeping it on my status even if i want to. Please consider this as a constructive feedback and hoping to see this feature in upcoming days.."
5,"It's an amazing app to use if you want to message multiple people or just a person. You can call and video call people as well as just texting. You can send emojis and GIFs, photos and videos without having to pay money for it!! It is truly an amazing app and I recommend it for people who just have messages or messenger üòÅ"
4,This is a very effective social app with all the stunning features. I would've give five shiny ‚≠ê's but for the recent change in the emojis tray. The former tray was easier to navigate through unlike this recent one where one has to be careful not to move into the next category of emoji. Kindly bring back the former emoji trayüò©.
2,"The new emoji/gif/sticker interface is not efficient at displaying them, especially when you have multiple sticker collections and when you select the last one it goes thru a long scrolling animation, which is totally unnecessary and at times dizzying. Why ""fix"" something that's not broken?"
1,"Why is it that everything Facebook touches turns to garbage? You used to be able to send any video footage within minutes on WhatsApp. It near enough killed normal text messaging. Now WhatsApp only allows a certain length and still struggles with its own set parameters. 6 minute videos constantly failing to send. Retry, retry, retry. Might be best to stop focusing on whose the biggest waster between him and Musk and actually concentrate on keeping the app working."
2,the new keyboard layout is killing the app. it pushes all the text to the top of the screen and theres a huge blank space. its so unintuitive to find stickers now because the selection bar for stickers and emoji at opposite locations of what they are for every other app. there was no need to reinvent the wheel..
1,"This has been great for years, but now there seems to be a new emoji interface which is waaaaay too small to use (like , it shows me the option to choose emoji or gif, but then it's too small to actually show any emojis to click on), and the bar which I'm assuming is meant to let me drag it bigger doesn't respond. So like, no emojis for me I guess."
5,"One of the best app's i have on my phone,no adds. And they kept their promise,but I'd love it if you guy's can add the feature of status saver, because having a status saver is another issue, that is where we get the adds and waiste our data. Please on the next version add the status saver option."
5,"I love Whatsapp! Love how it gets updates regularly. The messages are really private and only the person you are messaging can see them.But best of all?NO ADS!Been using it for a whole year and not a single ad.It can send voice messages,stickers ,photos ,videos and gifs ,links and docs too.Can also call groups at once,making it so easy to communicate."
3,This app is extremely functional in every single way except for some reason I don't get notifications from it. I have checked my notifications in my phone and in the app multiple times they're always enabled. I'm not sure what the the problem is but I would really like to get my notifications for people that text me.
4,"Overall, it is a good working app. Calls and video calls could lag a little less, but it isn't as bad as it used to be. Another option to log into WhatsApp Web must be added by developers, as scanning QR code isn't always an option. You may not have your phone with you and that is most probably the reason why you need to use WhatsApp web üôÉ"
3,"Great development so far. One thing I noticed in the recent update is that while going through messages on a group chat of about 1000+ messages and you want to reply to one of them, the moment you send the message it takes you down to the recent chat and one might have to scroll back up to continue from where they stopped. And it wasn't like this in the previous update. Please kindly rectify this."
1,"I've not tried everything functionality wise in the app yet, but have noticed right away that chats now have messages indented from the left giving less comfortable view than it was in the older design. Plus, now I cannot share .mp4 and .webm short videos from the local storage - some unhelpful error pops up saying that video cannot be uploaded"
4,"Good app, I use it to text my family members, friends, etc. But i really wish that you could like use face filters, etc. And make longer videos in the app, Example: Send longer videos in the status section. I also wish that there was a button that could be a ‚Äû make sticker ‚Äû button or ‚Äû create sticker ‚Äû. More fonts would be nice too, And a BIGGER colour / color palette / schemes. Example: darker, lighter, grayer colours / colors."
1,"I'm using it on my new phone Samsung galaxy a04, and when I just installed and transferred the data from my old phone, the app ran OK, but after that it crashed once and since that I can't open it whatsoever, tried restarting and reinstalling but nothing seems to work. It seems to be bugged somehow. Please fix it ASAP."
1,"Since update changes to emoji choices takes longer, preferred option across the top to choose what category of emoji much better before. . Now have to scroll through everything if for example you want the flags, as last category. Also text box completely disappears & is covered by the emoji choices. Have to keep going back in & out of text or emoji to see whats already written in text box. Please look at this, it's not a positive change."
5,Love the app and love the edit function! Keep up the great work! Another improvement that would help a lot is an ability to schedule your messages - Microsoft teams does it where you hold down or right click the send key and a scheduling tool pops up which is quite convenient.
2,"It is frustrating that the new update on WhatsApp is causing the stickers feature to not work properly. When I click on the sticker icon, it opens up WhatsApp Stickers instead of my favorite or last used stickers. Additionally, the delete icon on the status view has been removed, making it confusing when you want to update or remove your status. This new update is really annoying!"
3,"Hi, on watsapp voice call other party can't hear my voice, nor can I send voice messages as my voice don't get recorded. I receive watsap voice calls but other side can't hear my voice, my voice gets through though. I have checked and corrected all possible issues, after searching from Google, including microphone cleaning, allowing use of microphone, updating app, clearing cathe, removing memory card."
5,it's great but the contact edit feature will create new profiles? like it shows 4 different profiles when i change contacts that are able to see status/pfp/last seen it's not that big of a deal but it's quite annoying when i want to change things in big amounts cos it shows a huge amount of contacts selected even if i only clicked on 4.
3,"The app is nice, but my problem is the exclusion of the ""search"" on the ""status"" page. So If I want to view someone's status particularly, I have to just keep scrolling when I could search directly for the person's name instead"
3,"Every update so far has been good however, this change of keyboard format style is not welcomed in my opinion. I don't use stickers and gifs more than emojis and to no longer be able to just swipe to search for different emojis is annoying, same for stickers. Really wish there was an option to select your style of keyboard for emoji and sticker placement."
2,"I am deeply disheartened by the persistent issue I have been facing with WhatsApp's 'About' feature. It has come to my attention that the 'About' section is not functioning properly. Whenever I attempt to change my about, the app displays a message indicating that it is updating, only to later inform me that the update couldn't be completed, and I should try again. It's been two months this cycle of frustration has persisted..I hope that the issue can be resolved swiftly so that I can enjoy it."
2,It would be better if there was a watsapp reminder feature so i can write it to someone or a group and they could get notifications of it. And when we send multiple pictures the first one chosen must go first even if the picture needs more data to transfer still it should be sent first. Also if possible it would be better to have a list continuing system like a poll feature but to add names etc everytime we have to copy add and then paste the list of names etc
1,"Worse than Telegram or Signal. No edit function. Keeps all media on your internal storage, without even the option to have it automatically saved on the SD card. Nothing good about this app. I'm using it only because others do. Signal and Telegram are MUCH better."
3,"Quality of this App has been in steady decline for the past 6-10 months. It glitches, freezes, splatters random letters and spaces throughout any message attempts. Act like it has a virus or something and will NOT allow me to uninstall it so I can reinstall it!!! Why has the degraded performance of WA gone unadressed?!?"
2,"New emoji keyboard sucks! Please bring back the old tabbed style, finding an emoji now takes way longer! Also, somehow it stretches up way to high when opening, and then reverts to the regular keyboard height. The problem with this is that the !messages and send-key do not revert to the proper position, unless I manually resize the emoji keyboard..."
4,"The app is awesome. This time I suggest to set the option 'hide channels' or 'block channels'. In my opinion is more comfortable and visual if the channels aren't always in the updates screen, and I consider that if the user can choose if remain it or quit it is better."
4,"Its been good since I started using it, but the app has been having some funny bugs lately üíîüòÇ. When I switch from my text keyboard to WhatsApp emoji keyboard, the input field moves way up the screen‚Äì almost close to the notchüòÇüòÇ If this is a bug, please fix it. I'll be waited for an update accompanied by bug fixesüòå"
1,"Hate update to emoji menu! Open/close TRANSITION slow. changed placement of the icons totally counterintuitive. BACKSPACE KEY in bottom right lined up with its position on gboard;it felt intuitive. Shifted to top right=constant misclicks. After pressing SEARCH button for emoji menu, cursor stays in the chat textbox, instead of moving to search field that opens. This used to happen automatically before. HORIZONTAL scroll for emoji sections was better than vertical. Separate stickers from emojis"
5,"I enjoy the App and how you keep updating it every day. But what I suggest is that you should create a cloud storage for Whatsapp i.e you can logout and login anytime without lost of any Data like the way Facebook is, you can access your chat, files, and media whenever you like no need for backup because sometimes that backup happens to be frustrating. Thanks üôè"
3,"Great App, but Profile Picture Issue Needs Fixing . The problem arises when I try to delete the entire chat to clear messages sent to my own number in one go. Unfortunately, in doing so, my profile picture gets automatically removed as well. This unintended consequence has become quite frustrating, as I constantly find myself having to re-upload my profile picture after cleaning up my chat history."
4,"Most all of it was fine, but pls when I post a video in status it was very low quality even the real video was very good quality(fix this) . And when I want to do some sketch with paint, the color disturb me place that I want to sketch and I think you have to place the crop. That's all, ty and I love your apps‚ú®"
2,"Please fix the upload quality of Photos and videos settings. Allow us to upload in HD. This is really disappointing. Also, just like how we can set our last seen to be private and we also can't see other people's last seen (which is fair), please add the same feature for deleting messages and status viewing (which will also be fair like the last seen feature), if you get what I'm trying to say... I'm always hoping for these features to be added. Please."
2,Please bring back the old status interface - the new version doesn't allow me to easily delete the old status. One touch is better than multiple touches to get to the right status. We would always like the option to choose. Thank you
1,"Lots of bugs, the emojie keyboard doesn't properly work. When you close the emojie keyboard, switchig back to the text, the text box has a lot of space and is not functional. When you type emojis, they don't show up fully in the text box, unless you close the keyboard. PLEASE bring back the previous version with normal emoji keyboard!!"
1,"it was working very well but I have a problem with the voice message. I can't hear voice message, when I click on it then nothing happens and voice message does not start. same thing happens when I send to my voice message to other party then I am unable to listen my own sent voice message. I checked all settings or permissions everything look fine. I checked update from Google Play but I did not find update for this product. if I uninstall this product and then reinstall this product. Helpless"
5,"Hello WhatsApp team. I requested you update it to new feature in group conversation that filtering the chat, that shows messages from only one person who ever we select. It is very difficult to find the messages of particular person in the long conversation of the group. Please üôè include this ""messages of particular person "" option in the next update."
1,"Please fix the latest emoji panel changes! Tapping the emoji search icon will NOT focus the input field of the search. Instead, typing will CLOSE the entire panel. In addition, the newly added emoji panel animations feel slow. The whole flow of selecting emojis (super common use case!) now takes twice as long. Why was this perfectly fine feature even touched in the first place?"
3,"I have trouble forwarding messages. When I attempt to forward a message, it doesn't take me to the list of my contacts. Instead, it keeps loading. Initially, it'd load for about a minute or so before showing me my contacts, but now if I don't cancel the operation, I'm sure it'd keep loading forever. I sought help with whatsapp help, but no avail. I cleared my cache. It's making the app awfully difficult for me to use. If not for some official contacts on my whatsapp, I'd have long deleted it."
1,"I have used WhatsApp for several years, seldom had problems until 4 days ago when I stopped receiving messages or messages delivery notifications. Further to the issue, WhatsApp Desktop and Web create errors when trying to log in using QR or phone code. I contacted support multiple times with detailed errors, screenshots, etc to try to debug. Only answers are an automated regurgitate of what is already on the Help Center. It is useless, beyond frustration that since Meta bought it got so bad."
1,"There's no option to change chat-box background transparency, so my background image won't get covered that much by the chat-box. Just put it in the theme settings, it won't disturb anything, i bet everyone that use custom background image would like this feature, and an feature to change it's color. i mean the frame that contains the chat. It will be amazing"
3,Great for communication. The biggest issue I have had is not being able to schedule messages. This is functionality that is built into almost all other messaging apps. If WhatsApp is to stay ahead then it has to have ALL the functionality of competitors.
1,"I agree with many of the recent reviews regarding the layout, especially with the emotion icons. You cannot see what you are typing and which emotion icon you are selecting with the icon pop screen blocking half the textbox. Please can we revert to what was working previously. Thank you"
1,"Terrible connection despite good bandwidth of wifi, keeps going on reconnect all the time, in the past, this was never the case, but every now and then in the middle of the call it keeps showing reconnecting which is very annoying while talking. Edit: has gone from bad to worse"
1,"I don't like the new updates of this app, the change of places where emojis, stickers, giffs is so. annoying and also it makes my chat half invisible...and also there's vedio msgs icon in the same place where we can send voice msges..i find it very unsafe..now easily we could send vedios by mistake that is really bad one...i like the before version and new ones are really really annoying."
2,"Decent app overall. Changes needed: FTLOG show an approval prompt before making a voice or video call ESPECIALLY IF THE CALL IS TO A GROUP! People press the call icons by accident all the time. Prompting users to confirm that they actually want to make a call is a simple way to avoid inconveniencing others by accident. Allow users to add their contacts to different collections without having to create a group; then allow users to control privacy, and notifications per collection."
1,"newest update's so terrible, there is so much things that annoying. The emoji keyboard was the worst so far, it's kinda like the user ourself needs to adapt to the stupid updates? First, it's way slower to load. not to mention that the delete button move to the top. Also switching between emoji/gif/stickers is very confusing. Former version was better than this. jst give it back"
4,"As much as I love WhatsApp, I just want one more feature. On Facebook, we can go to notifications and there's an option of ""Mark as read."" Can you add that feature to WhatsApp status? Because honestly, it's not everytime that I feel like going through so much status, and I don't want them there anymore."
1,Shocking. Just lost 17 GB of data because whatsapp decided to overwrite my Drive backup with a smaller one. During restore I noticed that 2 week old backup is going to be downloaded so I left it at that and logged in on old phone again to re-backup. Somewhere in process I ended up with old backup being deleted and stupidly I deleted WhatsApp data on one of the phones (I was switching forth and back). There's only one backup to choose from although I still had 50gb allowance on Google Drive.
5,All is good technology made all closer. Thanks to whatsapp But your new roll out to text unknown number without saving should be optional switch on and off option. Example- If they wish they can activate by sliding right and not left. Because it is a safety part. Unknown people texting is temporary and it is unknown. Keep safe. BECAUSE safety is first priority.
4,Custom notifications & sounds are seen/heard after a delay of a few minutes; this was not an issue before a few updates in the past few months. And the backup notification comes up even when the app isn't actively backing-up. Look into these.
1,"At some point, incoming WhatsApp call notifications stopped showing on my smartwatch - I only get a ""Missed Call"" notification (which comes up only after a person had tried calling) - why? They used to work in the past, so this is a big annoyance. Just to mention: the notifications for mobile calls work fine."
3,"In spite of having who can see that I'm online set to everyone, since the last update the functionality is often freezing (suddenly online stops showing for everyone in spite of them not tweaking their settings) until I enter the privacy menu, only then it starts working again, before stopping once more after 5 mins. And the cycle repeats..."
3,"I'm using Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. My WhatsApp chats are not sorted chronologically. When a new message comes in, it's supposed to come at the top of the chat list, but that's not happening. The only solution I've found so far is to force-stop the app, and then the chats are sorted correctly. However, if I receive a new message after that, it won't sort automatically again. When i use the same whatspp account in another phone its working smoothly. Pls let me knw if any one else facing this?"
2,"With the new update (which it updated itself, I didn't agree with updating the app) it doesn't work at all. It used to pop up my keyboard when replying to messages which was perfect. Now I need to tap the text bar again to open my keyboard. Also the emoji section has been weirdly changed. Somehow my keyboard glitches and gets very slow when I want to add an emoji. Also the screen gets filled for ‚Öì by empty space between the Emoji section (‚Öì) and the above chat. Please set it back :("
5,"WhatsApp is an exceptional messaging app that revolutionizes communication. Its user-friendly interface, end-to-end encryption, and cross-platform compatibility make it the go-to choice for millions worldwide. With features like voice and video calls, group chats, and file sharing, WhatsApp keeps us connected effortlessly. It's a must-have app for staying in touch with loved ones."
4,"It will be great if it includes small little feature like i Telegram, after we open chat it will still ""unread"" before the text showed up on the display area, instead of the app change all unread text become read although the text still out of display area. The feature really good for active group chat"
3,"After every update, when I want to add an emoji to my message, the emoji tap literally separates or detaches from the message bar. Extremely annoying, I always have to delete and re-download the app. Even after backing up my data, very recent chats are lost. Horrible experience."
1,"Upload, download, backup & restore is too slow, upgrade your flash drive server to SSD. When we add a video in the status it should be ready to post and viewable. Not like I click on the video and it starts compressing for 69 hours. I cancel and add the video again, again it starts compressing in the background for 99 hours. You can't even see the progress is it compressing or stuck there."
4,"Hye Whatsapp team. Just would like to pin point you guys one (1) issue; not sure everyone is facing it or not, but the ""silence unknown caller"" stopped working after receiving the first unknown call. For the first time it work, but then it stopped. I have tried to check if I accidentally saved the number, but have went through my contacts and check, plus even did check my Whatsapp setting wether I turned off the feature. But looks like my side, all is positive. Hope to see an improvement ASAP.tq"
5,"Of all the messaging/call apps, this one offers by far the most crystal clear sound inside of call. Video calls are equally as good. The image quality doesn't decrease. But I like it the most for the audio calls."
2,"Latest updates are satisfied and user friendly. 1. Recent Sticker are not coming on top, it gets auto scroll to bottom screen and also user have to manually scroll and find recent Stricker. 2. If in any chat we scroll upwards just to check previous chat then it's moving 1 month prior chat and it's very complicated for us to search the chats easily. 3. Video Download functionality is also not proper we didn't get Play option on video screen after download the video. Request to fix this issue."
3,Can you please inserts the kebab menu icon on users updates/status back in your new whatsapp version? It makes me difficult to find my own updates/statuses if i want to delete it or see it. I have to keep on tapping until i found it. Please makes every new whatsapp version more convenient and have more features. And also keeps any features that already convenient. Do not change any features that already convenient to be inconvenient. I hope you can put the kebab menu icon back. Please. Thank you
2,"The lastest version of WhatsApp is the worst. It keeps crashing every time, if I attempt to forward a message or search for a contact it will take forever to load. I am really disappointed with how this formerly wonderful app is gradually turning to a mess. Please fix it up"
4,"Overall good üëç But some improvements needed here. 1- Speaking experience is not very good. Should be faster. 2- The feature to hide ""archived chats"" needs to be added. That chat can be conveniently viewed by going to the settings. Please don't ask me to send them in writing to email . I can't do that. I wrote as much as I could. thank you"
1,"I can't get the verification code even after trying multiple times. I also launched complaints multiple times, but every time, instead of resolving my issue, they sent me the troubleshooting options (which aren't working either). I'm unable to register my number, and all my data and contacts are lost!"
1,How is this new layout an improvement over the old one? It is cumbersome to navigate the emojis and does not feel intuitive at all. I really hope the developers fire the individual or team that are responsible for this change. Don't fix things that weren't broken in the first place.
1,Too many bugs in the recent update. User interface and experience too bad. Sometimes irritating. Emojis breaks into 3/4th. Chat text area widens without entering anything. Portion above chat area becomes a blank rectangular block. Sometimes Not showing enter message area at all. Stickers not loading soon. Too many issues since you changed the emoji sticker gif panel to top.
4,"Whatsapp is like backbone of communication these days. I want to suggest an improvement which will improve the user experience. Kindly assign different caller tunes to ""calling"" and ""ringing"". Currently both sounds same and one has to see the screen to check whether it's 'calling' or 'ringing'"
4,"Overall it's good and everybody knows it but there is an issue with the latest update, the option of sending video recording is not working properly, sometimes it doesn't open an when it opens up it didn't show anything on camera and also camera switching button is also not responding. May be it's not working in my Redmi note 10 pro max phone. Please fix this problem."
3,This is a very great app. I've been using it for a long time. But there is a problem I couldn't send a voice message it said 'recording' but it didn't work.so I updated it and i could only use it for a few seconds so please fix it. Love the app
2,"The emoji update is SUPER irritating. The screen jumps, have to pull up to find the ones I want, sometimes if I don't touch exactly the right spot, it jumps me back to keyboard typing before I've done my emoji. PLEASE bring back the old format or figure out a way to fix the emoji screen in place... Very disappointed in this update..."
3,The app works perfectly good but there is a problem or a feedback that I would like to suggest and is that nowadays there are a lot of scammers and I recently noticed Whatsapp added a new functionality that is to silent unknown callers but I think it would be a better option if they can apply a set up like telegram that they can only receive calls from the people that added for example if they have the setup available to receive calls from everybody or just from the contacts they have added.
1,"I'm facing issues with contacts it's showing the contacts which are not on my phone and they can see my status, it's really weird I tried uninstalling the app but it did not work. Please fix issues. I also saw one more issue where I was joy able to see the starred messages for locked chats after unlocking."
3,"Having major issues downloading images on my phone. Takes about 15 seconds to download each image no matter how small or how large it is. Internet is not the issue. It's always WhatsApp. No issues with loading content on any other program. Just click-to-download WhatsApp pics. Been an issue for months, since I upgraded to Android 14 beta, regardless of whatever beta version I'm on."
5,"Splendid! It can be more fun to use the app if the user can keep a record of status viewers. When it's 24 hours and probably one is sleeping, he may not know the number of people who views his status. Let the one who upload the story set the time the status would expire instead of just 24 hours."
1,"The worst messenger of all time. Why can't I turn of local back up feature, which is so annoying, why can't I easily transfer my chats between phones, all the methods does not work. Why can't I use my account on many devices simultaneously, and that's only the first things that came to my mind. Overall 1/10, would never use it, if it was not needed for work"
1,"Trash app. I have witnessed multiple incidents when people have been unable to backup their data from Google drive and have faced this problem myself. If you delete this app, data is as good as gone, keeping in mind that they have the facilities to provide backup from Google drive"
4,"It's wonderful,but I still do believe the Status and sending of statuses could be tweaked (The Quality still looks blurry even though we put it on best quality) let's improve the megapixels and make our videos/pictures cleaner and less like we using data saver because we do have WiFi(uncapped)and we do like to share the actual experience at the same quality we took the photos or videos."
5,"WhatsApp is pure magic! üí¨üåü It keeps me close to my loved ones, no matter the distance. The joy of instant messaging and video calls is unmatched. With end-to-end encryption, it's secure and private. My go-to app for staying connected! #WhatsAppWonder #BestFeelingEver"" üòäüì±üíï"
2,"Poor video call quality, unlike your competitor Telegram, and when sending and receiving files and photos, the quality decreases significantly Also, the latest update is the worst in the history of WhatsApp, so that WhatsApp statuses do not appear vertically and appear horizontally, and this is a very annoying thing with the emergence of channels on WhatsApp I hope to solve the problems, especially since you do not support calls via mobile data either"
1,"The new emoji board is absolutely AWFUL. The slide up animation takes ages, which significantly slows down texting and makes it less fun. Also, the emojis keep switching positions live, often leading me to tap on the wrong one. Why, just WHY? Why would you make something so much worse than it was before?"
4,"It's a wonderful app, so far I haven't encountered any problems using it. But I think if u could add a feature which will allow u to be able to edit ur status it'd be niceüôè. Assuming u want to make changes to ur caption...you'd have to delete the whole status and upload again wic is bad.üßê"
1,"I am not receiving messages on my watsapp. I'm able to send messages however I don't receive any. Even the sent messages show only one tick whereas, Same message has already been delivered and seen by the receiver. I have also cleared the watsapp data, unistall the application and reset phone several times but to no avail. Can anyone pls help?"
1,"While on chat , the interface on the emoji / sticker / gif emoji has changed . It's actually pretty terrible now - while typing a message , if I open the menu , it's much larger than my keyboard , and sometimes even hides the typing bar . Sometimes , it makes my keyboard disappear , and most times , when I select an emoji , it just randomly closes the menu . There are also horrible scaling issues ( menu is much larger than the keyboard , so looks horrible ) This is terrible - please revert back."
4,"Love the way the app keeps updating and improving each month and year, navigation style is cool on the chat list interface........ Security I'll rate more than 5 stars if it's possible, in concern to the app's UI, I hope it would be possible where the next update we could able to slide exit a chat than pressing the old android Nav, it'd be more easier and fast ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úåÔ∏è"
2,Whatsaap is such a great app and I use it from a long time. It's my first and best choice for messaging and video call. But I have little problem in the new update of emoji keypad. Sometime it's up and sometime it's stop and doesn't show emojies then I am not able to use emoji. Please change it and make it like before.
2,So...the new UI for the emoji functionality is so so bad. What were you guys thinking changing the position of the buttons?! The users are used to tapping right corner for something and now is upper right ... Hope this is just an AB test. LE the buttons are back in place. Thank you! LE2. The bad UI is back! These guys like to mess around with users...
3,"I've observed for a while now that I've been unable to join group chats through the link and I tried updating the app but I don't seem to see any progress, I think this should be fixed as soon as possible as I've missed a lot of information and opportunities. Though each update comes with a nice feature but that doesn't mean there should also be a downside to it."
1,"I don't know why but they've completely changed the emoji, gif and sticker keyboard. The texting bar has moved to the top which makes typing a little harder than usual. It also makes looking for emojis longer since it's all one continuous page. Bring back the old format."
1,Dear WhatsApp if you are reading this then please bring back the old interface for emojis stickers etc. I'm and so many finding difficulty using the emojis and sticker easily. The old interface was very handy. Slide reply rise up keyboard is also not working in this update. This update in actually declining user comfort. I hope you find it understandable. It was feedback for the improvement. Thank you.
4,NEXT SUGGESTION: An option that allows users to pick how WhatsApp starts...I.E. in contact list view or last conversation window. Personally I would like the app to default back to contact view so I don't (keep) accidentally respond to the wrong person when engaging in multiple simultaneous chats. üôÑ
1,"This app helps to send multiple documents at a same time but sometimes due to failure in message sent it is some bit confusing and time consuming process Please improve the message counter of the app so that we can not only able to see the message counts but also able to see the type of messages like files, texts and images etc."
5,"Best app so far for me, but currently the updated app there's being some errors or glitching, like selecting a picture to put on one's story, changing the filters has been some error there, aslo the marks button nearly hiding to my phone control touches. Please help look into this. Thank you"
3,"3 stars for using daily Queer app, here's why: 1) impossible to send silent messages 2) can not adjust the input device and output device easily 3) WhatsApp seems to be deleting all old content, so, it is literally impossible to check what I had within my friends group chats And so forth (do not remember everything) . Great app for people in general, nothing to understand, everything is straightforward. However, work should be done because telegram is far away."
1,I don't like the current dark mode. This mode appears to be a mix of black and green. Because it is not a perfect black theme. It looks a bit dark green theme. I want you to replace the existing black theme or create a new black theme having this real black theme. Which is completely black. And there should be no adulteration of any other color in it. EDIT: It's been so many months but the developer hasn't done any work on it yet.Edit
1,"Why is it necessary to bring new versions ? So you're bringing new versions because you can't get a good version in an effort, Every time there is a new experiment that causes the mobile to affect the rem, your new version has made my whatsaap gradually. You do not close the old version, we should give the right to choose those messages so that the new version does not sport the mobile, then we can choose the old version back"
4,"While sharing media in the app, the quality of photos and videos decreases If there is HD video or photo while sharing the status, it gets blurred and the quality decreases. If you want to share media in Chats, it has to be documented and shared and for that a high speed network is required. Please solve this problem."
1,"I don't know why whatsapp always like this, like, what's the point of cloud backup to google if whatsapp story of all my friends contact are not backed up? It only back up recent updates from 3-4 hours ago, and the only thing that has been restored is text based story and picture, other media like video isn't included! Annoying as hell, fix the system."
2,"I honestly felt proud of WhatsApp because until a few months ago, it supported a huge selection of Andriod versions. It ran on my older smartphones and I personally admired WhatsApp's strong legacy. I understand that evolution is a part of life and we have to throw off everything that gets old - but why? I love all my devices and I have kept them in pristine condition. But if major apps stop their support, they lose their functionalities more and more. I absolutely do not appreciate that."
1,"What's happened to WhatsApp? Seriously though, before the update, I was able to send videos with audio. now I'm lucky if a video even sends. why is this? and if a video sends, I have a 50/50 chance that there will be audio! you guys have to fix this, it's annoying."
1,"From best to worst experience. Files like /storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.whatsapp/WhatsApp/Databases/msgstore-2023-08-07.1.db.crypt14 that I could only view if I authorised to show hidden files and directly access the folder, are now directly accessible by Google Files as if it was a document. Too much time spent on useless features and nothing on security and privacy. Unfortunately I cannot stop using it because most users have not realised that Line and Telegram are much better."
3,"I hate the new layout of the emoji and keyboard. It was perfectly fine, now it's a mess, please put it back the way it was. The UI is so confusing and the stickers always show the default sticker instead of your most recent stickers, what's up with that?"
5,"Hi! great app! Can I suggest a feature? What about customizing other people's profile pictures for your own phone? Like, it doesn't change theirs, but it's specifically for how we see their contact. Just like names! I need this to remember people's faces, and I thought it'd be a neat thing as well in general"
1,"I tried this to talk to my mom in Poland while she was visiting there. It never really worked very well, and now it absolutely will not uninstall. In addition to that, after I deleted all data and denied every permission, it randomly somehow shows up in various permissions that I know I didn't grant this application. I'm looking at performing the dreaded factory reset to get this off my device."
4,"Whatsapp is excellent for collaborating with people on ideas. It's also wonderful to be able to communicate and exchange files with my family members or colleagues. It's also convenient to be able to join specific groups through their links, and by using WhatsApp's built-in geolocation features, I can avoid getting lost and easily reach my destination."
1,"The App would've been a wonderful app, if not for the fact that for absolutely no reason all my chats were deleted. And when it tried to sort it out it didn't do me any good. Now I have lost hundreds of thousands of messages and I have no way of getting them back. Unlike Instagram, where it's impossible or at least rare to lose your messages."
1,"Horrible new layout for emojis and stickers, its confusing, not user fiendly and I guess its purpose is to show stats that people spend ""more time"" in the app, but that's due to the horrible new design. The old design was perfect, worked great for years. ""If its not broken don't fix it""."
4,"This app is amazing. It's recorded as the most common app globally. I really enjoy all the features. Personally, this app is phenomenal üëç But I've been having trouble with voice typing, and the settings say it's working. Ple√†se deal with this immediately. Otherwise, it's an amazing social platform. Thanks!"
1,"Latest update has ruined the app, emojis are hard to search and sometimes doesn't work, the emoji gif/box is too big, when typing a message and you go onto a second line the box doesn't expand so you can't see what you are typing! Been perfect for years, why meddle?!"
1,"I have no Idea what's wrong with WhatsApp after using for years of good experience i just encounter something annoying. Whenever I upload a status video some videos failed to saying "" can't upload this video choose another video"". fine, if it's some kind of restrictions then I can understand very well but the videos than I post aren't anything related to violation. It disturb my experience as I love posting status video I want the team to take care of this"
1,"The new update is not good. The emojis and stickers are not how they were, the layout changed, and it is not as appealing as it was before. Why fix something that wasn't broken? It was much better the way it was before. The emojis and stickers option is now above the keyboard and this doesn't make sense. When going to stickers, it doesn't go to your recent stickers, which is an inconvenience. Please fix it."
1,"Every time this ridiculous app updates, it requires me to delete at least two apps for the storage to update. EVEN THOUGH I don't REPLACE the apps I've deleted from the LAST update or use additional storage. There's nothing even different about the new updates. I'm only using WhatsApp because of my friends; if not for that I would never use it. Takes up way too much space for what it does."
1,"While switching between my mob devices, all my media files gone, cannot retrieve. Poor design for transfering/copying files between devices, not user friendly options. It says i have to scan QR code, but does not allow me to access Whatsapp menu on my other device; frustrating."
5,"WhatsApp is amazing and very helpful. The newly introduced chat lock feature also works fine. There should be an option while sharing files to share them with a locked chat as well by unlocking it with our fingerprint because I cannot directly share, for example, a screenshot with the locked chat. The chat just doesn't show up."
1,"Have been using WhatsApp for years and it's been great. My work stuff is also on whatsapp. However, since 7th Aug, I've not been able to receive messages on whatsapp. Have tried to uninstall & reinstall MULTIPLE times, even factory reset my phone also didn't work. I then use another number to register whatsapp on my phone and it works perfectly! Clearly, it's account issue. The biggest joke here is that the support is of NO SUPPORT AT ALL! pls work on it."
4,"I'm fascinated with all the features of this App like ""view once"" , ""chat lock"" e.t.c I will be glad if you could implement a feature to turn Off/On contacts status update because there are a lot of us that do not like to view contact status update and the status update are automatically loading with data that are meant to load important messages and files. Please, we look forward to see your consideration on this. Thanks."
3,"I have been using this app for 9 years, it was good but it has more perks than usual. Checking for new messages keeps showing up too frequently despite my good internet connection. I was able to forward anything to anyone but it either won't load or load too slowly even on cellular data. Please fix them and I'll rate 5 stars again."
4,"Great communication app, but i'd like you guys to do something about the video call.(too poor) Also, you should add an icon that saves viewing status, instead of installing a 'watsapp status saver' seperately. You still haven't done that and this is 2023. Anyways, Hi, I want to make a suggestion on a feature you should add in WhatsApp. Could it be possible that a group admin (in a WhatsApp group) post a status and everyone in that group can be able to view it? I hope you understand what I'm say"
2,"The new updates are so bad and unnecessary, the emoji sticker and gif keyboard now has animations which makes it slow asf and it was perfectly fine before so idk why they had to change it. The channels is ok but not being able to view my status individually with the 3 dot buttons like before really irritates me. Just change it back to the original WhatsApp"
4,This app is excellent and all the bad reviews that are in here are all keyboard problems not the app itself but the reason i gave my rating 4 stars is because of the amount of storage the app takes. It takes alot of storage and the backup data option is not working for me it keeps restarting the process.
1,"Very bad experience with what's app. My account is logged out automatically, when I tried to re-register, sms not coming for verification call verification also not working, tried to contact support team so many times, they did not understand my problem or they don't want to solve the issue. This is not the way,, what is my fault why I will suffer??"
1,The latest update made it really difficult to use the Emojis and Steakers....Emoji tray loads very slowly due to sliding animation and also goes back slowly.....The original layout was way easier and fast to use than this one... Updates like this should be implemented gradually....Its a bad idea to immediately transform the whole section of an App and force people to use it.... Atleast remove the animations and make it work fast or something.....
3,"Facing issue in video calls, for both incoming and outgoing, my video is not visible , I checked all the permissions, restart the phone but the issue remains still, can anyone help me here. I tried un installed And install again, but same problem. Every time i try to call, there is more echo all the time and no video visible from my end, but i am able to see the video of other person. Checked all permission and all the setting but no sucess. Version is also the latest one. Please help me .."
4,"- We should be able to edit and delete messages, without it showing a message was deleted in all chats especially group chats, indefinitely, Telegram has had this feature for a long time! - Finger print lock needs more options or a custom timer. 1 min is too short and 30mins is too long. Please add these features."
1,The new updates are quite boring. To start the change of status tu updates is so lame it doesn't even refresh by itself you have to scroll all the way so tiresome. Then the keyboard is just not the best at all. Good job on the short video section part it's cool tho. I prefer the older version by far it was just perfect whatever is happening in updates is not really helping.
1,"""Transfer chats"" didn't transfer all the media from my old device. Tried logging in again on the old device only to realise thousands of my media files were gone (guess the media folder was overwritten by the app). Thank you WhatsApp for deleting 5 years worth of memories. Multi million dollars of budget and couldn't develop a way of transferring chats and files to a new device."
2,"Everything is almost ok.. using on Android.. but after the last update, whenever I want to use an emoji the whole chat goes to the extreme top of the screen and the texts aren't readable.. the emoji selection panel is covering more than 3/4 of the screen which is useless.. and you've changed the positioning of Keys, for backspace, selection of GIF or Stickers.. it's irritating.. please remove this fault and get back to the previous version of emoji panel.. the new thing is so frustrating.."
1,"After the last update, the user experience has worsened tenfold! It is VERY difficult now to navigate the whole emojis section as GIFs and stickers are now placed at the top, taking so much unnecessary space, and making it so MUCH harder to find the right emoji in the, now even more, limited space. For many users VERY useless who like me do NOT use stickers and GIFs, or more than emojis... Inefficient, frustrating, very difficult to navigate to find the right emoji. Old layout back, please!!"
1,"The new update made adding emoji really frustrating. In order to see them, I need to pull the emoji bar up manually, and still I cannot see all recent ones at once like before. When adding multiple emoji in one message, this gets really annoying. Makes me want to contact people through other apps."
3,"There's a major issue in whatsapp, Should CONSIDER this problem. When you share picture or videos they become blur and quality drop down. Now this issue is more than before Even I made UHD video it becomes blurr on whatsapp and other person can't see it properly.! Kindly re consider this and so that images and videos can be send in original quality and Pixels!"
3,"Great messaging tool, status feature is unnecessary, and video calling has audio feedback after a call has been going on for arround 30 mins, fixed by resetting the call, I mostly only notice it when using headphones but you can hear it after a whil e without too, seems to also only happen on calls of 3+ people not single calls"
1,"Every time I use the voice input option on this application only, It will write the full message that I say, but then delete half of it. It is so annoying and has been doing it for a long time now, but only on this application, so it must be a WhatsApp issue. Not that anyone will give a damn."
5,"I have a possibly better feature idea. Ping. When someone left you on read, perhaps you can ping the last message you sent then the messgae will pop up in their notification bar like any messages. I think this is a better way than chatting the same text again."
1,"Bad. I can't take videos and either send voice notes because there is a delay with the voice notes, almost 1 min recording to find out that hasn't been sent. A with the videos, you hold the bottom and 1 sec after said ""error"" and go back to the chat. When it get fix I'll change my rate to 5*."
3,"Very glitchy operation since the update on the 14th. Hit send on message & it shows a blank box, hit the blank box or back button & it sends your message then. Emoji box is wierd too. I haven't tried the new features yet so can't comment further, just the glitches now are very annoying."
5,"WhatsApp is simply fantastic! It's my go-to messaging app, and I can't imagine life without it. The user-friendly interface makes chatting with friends and family a breeze. The end-to-end encryption gives me peace of mind knowing my conversations are secure and private. The app keeps getting better with frequent updates, adding new features that enhance the overall experience."
4,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 7/21/23: Now I'm very happy with the feature ""Link device to existing account"", that's awesome! Using whatsapp in more than one device is needed and fantastic. ‚≠ê 9/22/21: Can't use it in two different smartphones, same phone number/account, it's a very horrible limitation of the app."
1,"The WhatsApp on my phone is keep misbehaving, i do not why! For instance, if i login my account, after awhile, it'll automatically closed and what i will see it, ""your account isn't allowed on whatsapp""!! I've used my three numbers on whataspp but still, it's stay misbehaving and l am keep losing my contacts. Please, help me out, l keep losing my documents!!"
1,"I wish WhatsApp status was over 30 seconds, I wish there was at least a 1 minute limit for status voice notes and nowadays, WhatsApp has way too much bugs. I'm starting to dislike the app. The videos sent in the app are heavily compressed. They don't even give you an option to post it in the full quality"
4,"Wow! I love the new updates; especially with the editing text effect that was introduced. My only challenge is still the inability to add multiple accounts on the same app. If this can be included, I believe the app will be highly efficient."
2,"Sorry to say this, all new updates are very bad. It delivers the features but lacks smooth usability. The old WhatsApp had stable ui, stable feel on using. I have noticed the following in Android 12, motog71 5g 1. Scroll issue: once start scrolling slowly to older chats it just skips a lot of chat and will be very behind. Noticed only ones with lots of text history. 2. The new emoji, sticker, avatar, gif panel earlier it didn't have the slide animation which is better since there is no delay."
2,"Good App Yaar But it Wont allow us to Upload Status Doesn't Matter if it's a Photo or Video in High Quality. A 2k video drastically being reduced to 720p resolution or even worse and an high quality photo gets so blurry like it was screen shoted thousand times or something ü§¶,same goes for sending a video or photo to someone. And we have to find a 3rd party app for it to do!Even i have done all the settings in WhatsApp to comeover the problem but no use. Why reducing it's Quality though?"
5,"There is a glitch in video sharing on status update. Sometimes the audio doesn't play automatically. May want to look into it. Apart from that, regardless to say, it's one of the best messaging apps."
1,"If I Shake My Phone Mistakely While Playing A Voice Message, Then My Screen Turnes Off And When I Turn On The Screen And Try To Listen The Voice Message. I Hear Nothing But The Voice Message Still Play But It Mutes. Then I Close What's App 2/3 Times. After Closing 2-3 Times. I Re-Open And Then I Can Hear The Voice Message Clearly. It's Really Disgusting. I Don't Understand How Can It Do That. Your Institution Is One Of The Best Institution Of The World. How Can Your App Has A Problem Like This."
2,"I love the app, it's great and all that but when I leave the app to do something else on my phone it starts hanging.....and when it hangs I keep getting the ""WhatsApp is stopping"" message. It is really annoying ..... secondly i back up my messages mostly at night but one time during the day....before I could back up ...it asked for restore back up and deleted my chats .it was hard because that chats include useful information, which is now vanished into the air or wherever.. please fix this"
3,"Since the new stickers layout update, my keyboard minimizes each time i get a message notification in WhatsApp. Also when i choose to reply to a message, my keyboard doesn't automatically pop up. And finally the animation to open the sticker tray and switching from stickers to keyboard and vice versa is slower than before"
1,"Why did you guys have to go and mess up the emojis and GIFs thing. Put it back it was completely fine All of a sudden I can't send videos. I keep getting an error message telling me to restart my phone. I tried everything, even uninstalled WhatsApp and reinstalled after 4 hours of backups. Still same issue."
1,"The latest update with channels sucks. No search option for status, then the horizontal display of status doesn't look good at all. Just give channels a separate tab and let the display of status remain vertical. That tab is just too busy."
1,"Great app but HATE the new emoji shortcut bar/'sticker tray' layout. Years of muscle memory from selecting emoji themes from the top of the emoji box on EVERY other app make this new layout an unfathomably stupid design. And I can no longer quickly scroll to the bottom of each emoji type cuz it over-scrolls to the next type. Plus the unnecessary headings for each type taking up space... I use emojis so often, it's driving me nuts!!!!!"
5,"This app is great. Well, actually, I want to have a suggestion for you, maybe it's not important at all, but I'll say it. I want you to add a tag to your WhatsApp statuses so that the person you are tagging could get notification, and if possible, raise the profile settings in your new version so that no one can take a screenshot of someone's profile. Thank you so much."
1,"Whatever happened to restoring from backups? Just recently I tried to change phone and restore a 200 MB back up, but the restoration page hung and progress bar didn't change... In the end I had lost all that data even though I managed to get my chats. My second backup was hardly 10 MB, but when I tried to restore the backup again, the same problem happened. And I couldn't load my chats. Never had this occurred beforehand. Sth has to be done about it."
3,"ü•∫I was totally excited to try out the new features of the updated version, unfortunately I'm sad to have to report that the instant video message doesn't have sound. The video is able to be recorded and sent, but it is without sound. It's as if it's muted even when it isn't. üòüüòüüòü"
2,New update is terrible. They changed the emojie interface wich was totally unnecessary now it's very difficult to select emojie as the emojies keep on rotating the backspace placement is changed now which is very irritating as when you want to click on backspace you just unconsciously click on another button. It would have been better if the didn't change the emojie interface
1,"With the latest update, my whatsapp stopped working! No outgoing or incoming messages. Why does it get worse with every update? It is also very annoying that you have to play a video message from scratch when you answer a call while watching the video! Could it be worse than that?"
1,"WhatsApp is absolutely a horrible message app, voice notes do not open and when they open, the volume decreases and increases automatically in no particular order, the phone's screen also turn off in the process which makes one have a bad experience with the app"
5,"One of The Best Free Communication App's Also, it has end-to-end encryption security features and I don't need to worry when I text someone or share my pictures and files. It allows me to stay connected with my friends and family members all the time and I really enjoy using WhatsApp daily."
5,"I get a notification but it was blank. The new edit button is good, but it doesn't let you edit text in a photo where the text is linked with. My friend has responded to my message but it still shows 2 white ticks. Fix this glitch it is really annoying when I know my friend has seen the message, and even responding with the 2 white ticks not changing to blue."
1,"Meta! Get your act together and reverse to the previous layout of the app! If ain't broke don't change it - the new design to write messages and, in particular, use of emojis is absolutely awful, and to the point that makes it impossible to access them! Since you are proud of stating that you are listening to users, then LISTEN TO YOUR USERS AND REVERT BACK TO THE PREVIOUS LAYOUT OF THE APP!!! I hope you are not too busy with messing around with the app and ignore your users request for revert"
1,"Whenever I now select a message to respond to, the keyboard doesn't open automatically anymore. I'd also like to have the option to choose to either use the old emoji/gif/sticker's layout or the new one. It takes twice as long to search the right one right now"
5,Absolutely not be disappointed with an unaltered game changer for the use and ability to work with the communities in the most honest and sincere ways I am not able to express... No longer in debt making long-distance relationship between just in time and consideration at last I can think of nothing better than this one of a kind reminder that we have been a huge fan of saving money through your almost all cases going by now has been a while and keep up the line of communication open and FREE.
5,"It will be a perfect app if export & import chat features worked like Telegram...If one could transfer media & complete chat history from one contact to other easily such that old & new chat messages with that person are arranged & synchronized according to time of posting, as a chat & not in .txt format. Also add option to move selected chats & groups from one phone number to other notifying only those contacts the change in account number. Right now it shows to move all chats & data together."
5,"It's really outstanding app .all the key functions I felt are very smooth i.e video call,voice call , sending messages. I have a small concern about to send pic ..after sending pic I felt it's quality get deteriorated....so it can be improved."
2,"I love the new updates, besides the emoji tray and the way its layed out, it was easier to use when the app had all the sticker, emoji and Gif icons were at the bottom because it is easier to use and I don't have to scroll until forever to find the emoji I want to use. Besides that, it has really nice features."
4,"Please put the archived messages at the bottom back. I'm sure most of the ppl archive some messages to hide them, so there's no point of archiving them if ppl can see it clearly at the top of the messages. Not to forget, pls add the plain SOFT PINK emoji heart ppl keep asking for. Also, instead of adding useless channels on updates, why don't you guys just solve the basic problem first?- I'm talking abt the upload quality of videos on statuses. Pls improve them."
4,"Despite being a stable, useful and simple app, I can't get over the fact that you have removed the searchbar from the updates UI. The SEARCHBAR! I can nolonger see my own updates in list view. I have to scroll down a long list to see a status I want or one that I had previously viewed. Not cool."
1,"After the update the new emo-sticker layout is so small that it's annoying to pick emos. I'd rather choose the previous layout. Why would you even need to change the layout? Even if you want to change it, why don't you give an option to choose which layout that the user want to use? I can't use emos easily like this because how small the window is. Change it back will you??"
1,"latest update is pathetic, stickers/emojis are now harder to access because of poor design of new section, it was way better before. also, when keyboard is not open and you select a message to answer it instantly, it used to open up the keyboard which was super convenient, now it does not. why change something that works good amd make stupid changes?"
2,"Lately received a message that says registered on a new device and i have check there's no linked devices, and i have two authentication on but still worries me... And sometimes received messages but no notification sound Lastly new update was not quite friendly as the last version... abit buggy when open stickers and if accidentally fast swipe u just skip to the next page üòÖ"
1,"I have been trying to tranfer WhatsApp from iPhone to newly bought nothing phone 2 since 10 days. I followed all the steps mentioned in the watsapp official website. It failed again and again. Once the data is moved from iPhone to Android, it failed at the time of start important (after 82%) to be precise. It is really frustrating. I realised that I did bet my data and conversations with WhatsApp which doesn't have autoback like Snapchat. I badly need to switch to a new messenger."
1,I am no longer able to answer the calls as there are no pop ups. It says it is not supported with my current Android version. I assume it is the latest update that caused it. So disappointing. Updates are supposed to be backwards compatible...
2,"Doesn't even give me sound for notifications, which that might be my phones fault (why I did 2 stars instead of 1), but it's only for this app, which makes me think it's an app problem. And yes, I have tried messing with the settings in both the app and my phone, but it didn't work for either."
5,"like the simplicity and utility of the Whatsapp. With this incredible tool, I can make business and personal transactions with pictures, videos, links, and documents in the same app. The best thing about Whataspp you can have a great chat experience with your family because the app is simple too"
2,"It does the job but the latest update on the emoji and sticker keyboard is way too slow and inconvenient, makes conversations extremely less smooth and is just completely unnecesary. Please give at least an option to turn it back into the original version."
4,"It is very helpful and a great messenger app, but recently i noticed that when i send a message and we have a full on conversation it doesn't say that the person has read it(the grey ticks don't turn blue), it would be very helpful if you could fix this problem."
1,"Why did you change the Status to Updated? It's fine if you changed the name, but why add a channel? I prefer using WhatsApp because it's easy for me to message my family and friends. I want to see their status, not from a public channel. You should consider adding this option to WhatsApp for Business instead of making changes to regular WhatsApp. I'm not pleased with the switch from status to updated. If you still want to do that, please put it in another section, not under the Status section."
4,"The App. is great but I will highly recommend that you add a feature that allows a user to set the time that a message will be sent. That Is, a user typing a message prior to the the time she intend sending it and it will send automatically at the set time. Please this would be so helpful."
3,Whatsapp is a great chat app. The only feature that really annoyed me is that WA doesn't have an option of actual size/compress version when it comes to sending media such photos and video. Hope the developer really considers this simple yet crucial feature.
1,"It lagging. I can't forward message. I can't forward content. When click in the content I want to forward and it takes me to that contact and status window: it loads forever, I won't see my status update and my contacts. I can't upload from my gallery or anywhere else anymore it does the same. What's happening?"
2,"The new Whatsapp with channels is very bad. We enjoyed when the tab for status was only for status, now with the additional channel, user experience has been destroyed. Having to scroll to the far end to view a specific status. Kindly let's have the channels go to a new tab and leave the status tab the way it was. We beg for that.... I will come back and review this to 5 star."
4,"The last update is really good, however, the arrangement of emojies has changed to a bad pattern, you can't type emojies as fast as before, if only you kept the old arrangment of emojies section, it was really comfy and easy to use, now it's confusing and really uncomfortable to select the emojies you are using frequently."
2,"WhatsApp use to be good but this last 3 updates are not good because of: 1) they have removed the search option from status area. 2) once you start following a specific channel in status it changes your contacts status making it to scroll from left to right, hence you view little status while scrolling. 3) when you you follow a channel. You can't comment or request on anything yet I was following a football channel"
4,"Generally useful, although as it has the capability / capacity to send and receive high quality images (upto a decent sized file) it can run slow in villages as the app seems to wait for ""maximum use"" rather than realising that a lot of messages are smaller sized text only messages."
1,'Improved navigation of the sticker tray' in the new update is horrible! Slow unnecessary animations and wasted space around the 'emoji / gif / sticker' buttons make it really annoying to use. Also the reset out of emoji tray everytime you change cursor position gets really frustrating. UX got a LOT worse...
4,It's a problem whenever you want to share the video but it's always blurry when it's supposed to be a good quality. No point being fast when it's completely blurry the video and thus took more time to solve the problem send video.
1,"Won't update despite enough space, cleared cache & data, & multiple restarting, device is compatible with the App. WhatsApp was fine before requiring this latest 26 Aug 23, Update. Now I've wasted many hours over 24hrs Trouble Shooting with no success. ----- It has now updated 28 Aug 2023, however I have LOST 3 WEEKS worth of messages?! Ridiculous."
2,"Improve the quality of uploaded pictures and videos it's bad . Videos looking like Cctv footagesüåö The new update is the worst, the emoji/sticker arrangement sucks üòë. What's with the chats, status bar being put at the bottom? Call log doesn't update after calls have been made. The new update was a terrible idea, fix it!!!"
4,"Hi Whatsapp Team, I have one suggestion for you, I would recommend you to implement/add the new tab under MY Status area ie Search button shown in below picture. If you include the Search (By name/number) button in My Status then that would be great and all users across the globe can easily find out who has seen their status by searching for a name instead of scrolling the list of status viewers. Please find the attached file for your reference, and forward to the correct team for implement."
1,"Changing from a 5-star rating to a 1-star jus because I can't give a 0-star rating. Why you developers at big companies think that it's okay to make some thing worse just for the sake of making it look new?! I just don't get it. The sticker panel is glitching at every click, it doesn't stay at recent stickers panel anymore! And switches to favourite stickers and that too randomly without rhym or reason! ""At least, let us toggle to the older, easier, and cleaner sticker/emoji/gif-panel."""
2,"Image editor used to have exactly one advantage over the image editor in messenger, which is that when inserting text, it didn't add unchangeable automatic line breaks based on an arbitrary size. It now does that, and the feature is completely superfluous."
3,"The Android version of this app is solid and I use it daily, but the WearOS version fails at its primary task: alerting me to new messages with timely notifications. I've seen messages not show up on my Pixel Watch for hours. Prior to installing the WearOS app, they would appear as quickly as text messages."
4,My issue with WhatsApp is allowing ALL members of a group to tamper with disappearing messages feature. Such that members can change the disappearing messages and put it when they feel it suits them. I'd like the developers to CHANGE and allow ADMINS ONLY to change the disappearing messages feature. It shouldn't be accessible to all members especially in group.
2,In new update video call auto rotate feature is annoying. The old one was better because it's always on vertical style even the mobile on horizontally placed. Please remove this feature and make it like old again or you can add a button for freze the rotation so we can use the way we want.
1,"Why is the setting ""Disappearing Message"" always got turn on automatically? Eventhough my DEFAULT setting is off? This has happened more than 3 times and making it inconvenience (history of chat/pictures are gone). The backup doesn't even work, always stuck at 70%... This is getting annoying"
5,"Best of luck.. Please add the security features to avoid false and agitated issues. Add more edit option. It can be added Edit Tools for better appearance. While we type something and want to edit with tools like font, color, margin, boarder etc, we can't do it. Please add effective font tools in WhatsApp."
5,"There's a issue, the edited msg don't change in the reply preview. Also text size cant be changed during photo editing, in other apps like snapchat, you can change size with 2 fingers pinch in or out so the words in a line can ce arranged. WhatsApp only allow to change whole paragraph size. Also private mode in WhatsApp would be lovely, like snapchat allows to know of the ss..."
1,"Just when I thought this app couldn't get any worse, this new Emoji-sticker UI sucks so much. It's very glitchy and what's worse is that when I try to click on a specific sticker it'll end up selecting another. When I click on the emoji section it doesn't open up at times. C'mon guys ?"
1,"This app has been the most awful thing to use in the past couple of months. UI/UX team needs to fix this because they moved buttons there are so many unnecessary context menus and the emoji/keyboard/sticker layout is absolutely disgusting. Fix this ASAP, it's sickening."
5,"Edit: WhatsApp was down, sorry for the bad review I had left üòÖ. Anyways I absolutely love the app, I've been using it for a year, but my parents have been using it for a long long long long time and we all love it. We never use the video chat or call feature, only the messages, so its all pretty easy to use. However, in group chats we can't see who has read our messages until everyone reads it. Is there a way to see who has read the message and who hasn't? Like little bubbles in the corner?"
4,I like the app actually and I've been using this app to communicate for so damn long and I really really love it and after you add the HD option on the attachment it becomes more interesting however we all dealing with the status low quality issues it would be much better if on the next update you add HD option on status video and photos too that's all we want and our problem will be solved ‚ù§Ô∏è
4,"So far I like the app. I'm glad they have kept its privacy when it comes to sharing posts and phone numbers. It is not liks facebook or IG. It has its delays on updating new features in videos and picture modes but it is also nice that they have kept it ""old school"" as well. Good job!"
4,"Give us The Option of Original Photo Quality. We WANT TO SEND PICTURES IN ORIGINAL QUALITY. What do you developers do? While sending any photo, its quality gets reduced significantly (even when the quality is set to ""best""). Please, please, 'please' give some heed to this comment and kindly add an option to send photos in their 'exact original' quality."
4,"The app is nice for communication and interaction. But copying of single words from and entire group should be introduced, i.e, when an individual wants to copy words from a group of words they mustn't copy everything. Thanks. Please also work on how messages are forwarded. Look at telegram and learn how to forward messages. Fast and easy. Please patterns and password should be allowed on WhatsApp as fingerprint is allowed for unlocking."
2,"The app's degraded with each update, ""something got wrong with your chat history"" issue will somehow popup on random days & on restoring the messages the non backed-up messages are lost, happened with me 2-3 times & lost messages for a couple of days including yesterday's (23/8/23, & I want those messages anyhow, just look into providing me my msgs WA team), automatic Google drive back-up has stopped despite all settings for daily 2am backup & internet being proper & I have to manually back-up."
3,Adding of some features to this app like; 1. Being able to down load a status directly without downloading ststus saver or screen shoting 2. Separating groups from normal chats it helps locate a group easily without using chat 3. Change of themes makes it more attractive 4. Being able to foward for more then 5 people And posting a status beyond 30 seconds The rest the app is very good thanks for developing it
2,"Hey, after the latest update I'm stuck on the preparing messages screens and it just keeps loading. Can't see my all chats, what's happening that? I've never seen this before is it a new feature update. Then try to look solution for this is very annoying. So, disappointing from WhatsApp üòû"
2,Please fix the bugs of the new version!! It is so annoying. Every time I add an emoji the text bar enlarges out of no where sometimes completely disappearing. I have to close the app and open it again for it to work!
4,"The interface is very easy to use, it will automatically sync your contacts and you can chat with them right away. The application is free, but it can consume a fair amount of mobile data, especially during video calls.In whatsapp you can create groups to communicate with friends, family or colleagues."
4,"Great app for communication and to be touch with friends, but kinda hoping you would add something to mark important messages in a group chats. It would be more convenient if I can see important messages in an official group so I wouldn't miss anything."
2,After this new update the interface of emoji/sticker menu is actually terrible. If i open an emoji menu it's much larger than my keyboard and sometimes even hide the typing bar so its really frustrating. Please fix this issue or revert back. Previous is was quite good and user friendly but now its horrible.
2,I had updated recently. Currently using 2.23.16.5 (Beta) version. New messages are not coming on top of every messages according to time. I have to close the app everytime then it comes on top. I am facing this issue since updation. I uninstalled it and installed it again but the issue not resolved. Many times switched off the cell phone as suggeted by team whatsapp via mail. But issue not resolved.
1,Pathetic. A person should have the option to upgrade the. APP rather than it been forced on them. Upgrading this app is to constant and takes up to much space on the phone. Always been forced to delete files and Apps that I don't want to loose.
1,A request to WhatsApp developers kindly make forwarding videos and images limit to only 2 groups or contacts! This is creating a lot of issues because fake news are getting forwarded with no limit! This is a major issue . Please consider this seriously. Since forwarding messages is so easy that people don't even make sure it's ligit and just forward the images and videos with no limit
3,"The backup feature is glitchy. It's difficult to backup up-to-date, two different WhatsApp to One Email Address on Google drive. One WhatsApp is up-to-date while the Second WhatsApp is almost a month late backed up on Google drive. I think WhatsApp can fix this glitch. Also, the WhatsApp lock feature & Chat lock feature on Android 13 should come with *Face lock* enabled, not just for IOS."
3,I use WhatsApp a lot but recently you changed the emoji keyboard. I don't like the look and functionality of it and worst of all it takes about a second to load up and then a second to close which is unacceptable. This used to be instant and the interface was better than any other emoji keyboard I use. Now I don't want to use emojis
3,"Honestly, transferring whatapp chats has always been a hassle. The new transfer chat feature was created to solve this problem, but its implementation is just plain irritating. When switching to a new phone, it should immediately show the transfer chat qr code instead of having to go to the setting and clicking transfer chat. You need to get the code and simultaneously click on the transfer chat button. Whenever I get a new phone, i just opt to start WhatsApp afresh and abandon my old chats."
2,"Not great since recent update. The majority of the time the Emoji window only appears in a small window at the bottom of the screen,and only shows one line of emoji. Rarely does it opens as it should. Unable to expand the window to show all emoji options."
5,"WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption to keep data safe while it is transferred from sender to recipient. So is WhatsApp safe to use? Yes ‚Äî texts sent through the secure messaging app will be encrypted while in transit, so only you and the person you're messaging can see them."
2,It's a great app but recently I have faced a issue im not able to customise individual tone for a particular chat and I'm not receiving any notification sound other than group notification and and no matter how many times I try to keep a particular ringtone it automatically changes the notification tone to different notification tone I'm just sick of changing the ringtone so often
5,"WhatsApp is a ubiquitous messaging application that has transformed the way people communicate globally. With its user-friendly interface and reliable performance, it has rightfully earned its place as one of the most popular messaging apps. One of WhatsApp's standout features is its end-to-end encryption, providing users with a sense of privacy and security. This means that messages, calls, photos, and videos are encrypted and can only be viewed by the intended recipients."
4,I rated it 4 starts because one of the updates where the phone automatically rotates during a video call isn't pleasing. I'd like it better if we had the option to rotate if we so pleased. Not automatically as the update would have it.
4,"The new update is causing WhatsApp to crash continuously. It opens, freezes the screen with the most recent chats and then exits itself. I wasn't keen on updating however it forced me to update. Been using Whatsapp for a long time and never faced such issue, kindly look into the problem."
1,After the recent update WhatsApp is crashing multiple times and is not working properly. I'm unable to use WhatsApp. The app is crashing continuously without any reason and affecting my phone's performance. Kindly resolve this issue as soon as possible.
4,"Nice improvement so far. However, you need to allow us to upload a WhatsApp status longer than 30 seconds, then automatically your app can break it in bits, and save us the hassle of having to keep re-uploading and cutting, it's not funny. Many thanks."
1,I changed my phone type and all my stickers just disappeared !!!!! And afrer downloaging my backup several times no stickers are backed up and the app keeps crashing and showing that message saying you have a problem with your messages and you can restore them now after restoring I only get empty groups !!!!!!! Now in August 2023 still crashing !!!!!!!!!
4,"Being honest, this app is one of the best messaging apps out there. Sometimes the new features can be quite buggy and hard to get used to, comparing it with another great messaging app Discord, Discord is slightly more advanced when it comes to chatting. But Yeah, if you're looking for a free messaging app i would highly recommend WhatsApp."
3,"After last update something wrong with emojis panel. When inserting emoji, message don't move up and you don't see that you have emoji in message. At least it's like this on my phone. Easy to check. If you start to insert many emoji, it will fill up first row of message and then will not move up. Please fix"
2,"I have enjoyed using whatsapp messenger for many years now with no issues, however this new update, the way it changes the emoji keyboard layout is impractical and honestly just annoying, I'm sure there's some that like it however I think it would be a good idea to offer an option to switch between the original and the new emoji panel design for those who do not enjoy the new design"
5,"The best and most fantastic communication app. However, I wish to suggest the Disappearing Msg (DM) feature be fine tuned to apply only to the person who set the DM and does not apply to other parties. Each party sets the time frame on his own outgoing and incoming msgs."
1,"This has bug or spam. Each time shows an error this video cannot be send try later or another video like. while other veraion in same number working in other phone, even videos of other able to send. I have reset device update device uninstall and install latest version yet error persist. Kindly fix it or remove from playstore."
3,I'd like to give it five stars but that would requiere two factors: - Stop adding functionalities nobody wants. But most importantly: - Stop removing functionalities that are plainly and simply too basic to even consider removing. Such is the case with removing the ability to see picture thumbnails from pictures sent from WhatsApp Desktop.
1,"Whatsapp stopped working without warning, device then asked me to update whatsapp, which I tried & I got a message: ""Can't download WhatsApp Messenger Try again, and if it still doesn't work, see common ways to fix the problem. I tried all the common ways suggested to resolve the issue but still no luck, I used whatsapp a lot to contact family & friends so I'm really upset that I can't access it, can anyone help with this issue."
1,Audio recording should have a set limit of few seconds or maximum 1 minute. The receiver of audio should be able to set the feature of enable /disable audio restrictions so that the audio sender are not able to send long annoying and frustrating audio messages and instead they know that this will be a feature allowed by the receiver.
4,Please return the emoji/sticker buttons back to its original placement. For long time users it is annoying having to get used to the new design. The backup function is always forever updating and stuck there for so long. Otherwise its 5 star.
1,This app is going downhill for the last few months. The transition that is applied when we switch to emojis takes a bit longer than desired. I can't switch quickly between emoji and text if I need to switch fast. Idk if WhatsApp team really cares about these feedbacks but God damn it ! do a good job and don't ruin these small features just because your developers ain't got nothing to do.
1,"What's with this new Emoji board arrangement? That was unnecessary. Please keep it the way it was. This new layout is very difficult to use. Everything's in different places, very inconvenient. Please Restore the old one."
1,Media visibility remains turned off by default on iOS. Not on android. Here if you reinstall WhatsApp and then restore backup it will just make all of your WhatsApp data to be appear on Gallery. Incredibly annoying as it will then start syncing to cloud and the user have to delete from cloud while making sure the local storage photos aren't deleted as they'll be gone from WhatsApp too. So much headache üò´
4,Please the last update I did. The app always go straight down to last unread messages instead of starting from the first one. I came back to add this: your emoji icons on the keyboard is in a bit mess. I click on one Emoji and it shows another. Let the dev team look into this. I don't know if I'm the only person experiencing this. I'll still leave it at two stars. I'll now give 4 stars because the recent update is now better
1,"Backup notification gets stuck. Icon looks the same as a message notification which is confusing and annoying as you keep checking expecting a message, but no, it's the broken backup. Even on completion it's stuck and can't be dismissed without a force close of whatsapp"
5,Amazing features added But would be very happy if one more simple features would be added which is like a silent message where the receiver will not get any notification of that perticular message. Once the receiver opens his WhatsApp then he'll get a notification that so n so person has send you so n so message at so n so time. Which would help when you don't want to distribute the person you are messaging. But also want to message them Coz you might forget to message them later.
1,It's a very useful app...but there's a bug..a huge problem I'd say... my friend drashtant gupta/nattu is using an app or some hack...and can read all my messages even after I delete them...kindly look upon this issue as it has become a complete breach of my privacy and needs to be solved with immediate effect.
1,I am using Redmi A2.And now I am having terryfing experience with WhatsApp. Because WhatsApp having serious problems with my phone. *1:- I couldn't Able to restore my WhatsApp data from my previous phone (during restore process WhatsApp stopped working.i tried multiple times but same result). *2 :- Sometimes I couldn't Able to send or receive any media through WhatsApp (It will just show loading......but not progress). *3:- Notifications were not properly notifying *4:- overoll too slow WhatsApp
3,"I requested the verification code many times, and a specified time was given to me until I could try again. But when it's due time, it displays the same thing, either by an hour or 24 hours. Requesting a call does the same thing, and it's very frustrating. I'd like it very much if the team did something about it."
2,Becaus i cant get the Support Team too understand issues. Probably a bot that gives answers. Anyway for anyone that normaly turn their notifications on. The new Android update version 13 it is not possible anymore because the notification is not supported for that version in whatsapp. And the Support Team keeps references to activate your account. So that wont help you. And there is no anwser in their FAQ.
2,"Latest update is bad. Changing the usage of emojis, so there is a difference in the hight of keyboard and emoji window. This isn't a good UX design imho. I dont want to scroll down through all emojis, changing via tabs was totally fine. Please change back as it was before!"
1,"Glitchy and at times non responsive. It used to work really well, without any problems. But now it stops, there's no audio, the video skips. What happened Whatsapp ?? You guys messed it up!"
4,"Everything is ok but the theme glitches. I've set my phone to dark mode and whatsapp doesn't bond well with it. Whatsapp light mode on phone's dark mode looks like a dark green theme Honestly I don't care about that, but I'm unable to read some options as its text and background are in white colour. Whatsapp dark mode on phone's dark mode is a mega dark mode which yet again, doesn't bother me I still can't see some options since it's ""too"" dark. Please have a check."
1,"This poorly designed auto backup blocks me in the middle of conversations with automatic ""Backing up messages"" that taking up forever in the middle of usage at noon day! Could you ever auto backup silently, in the background, at resting hour, instead of bugging users with this opinionated design? If there is ever need to tell user that auto-backup is ongoing, you can do it in less obstrusive way than stalling the apps and blocking users from using it."
1,So WhatsApp has been clearly abandoned by Facebook.. Bluetooth headphone support has been broken now for years now. It just doesn't work. Pressing the Bluetooth icon in the app never works and the audio always sounds trough the phone speaker. Works fine with any other app.
1,I like whatsapp but i wish we could listen to some live music while talking to anyone. Or maybe we can share live song as well with the person just like discord. Rather than switching to other apps... i think it should have all the lists of songs so thay we can listen to music live
1,"i would prefer the old layout for the gifs and stickers, the ux for the same was much better, now i need to move my finger halfway through the screen to switch between the emoji, gifs, stickers tabs also it takes up the entire screen as opposed to the half screen layout for the previous version."
5,Excellent App. Lately there have been lot of improvement in video quality. Voice is very clear. Certain remote areas still have problems. Over all a good app.
1,"It's so darn difficult to transfer chats to a new device, i have backed up, then when it says transfering from the backup found, nad then it cancels. I tried so many times and ended up deleting new messages i have received in the mean time. Then i tried the new feature transfer chats to new phone, didn't work, also got canceled for aome weird error"
2,Bought a new phone and attempted to transfer the chats using WhatsApps feature of having the old phone nearby. It clearly didn't work properly as my chats were mixed up and I lost access to some WhatsApp groups. To the point that my app crashes any time I try to open the group. This needs to be fixed ASAP
5,"Whatsapp is simply the greatest. A small suggestion: Can you make the ""Ringing"" text during Whatsapp calls to blink and the ""calling"" text should remain still. It makes a lot of difference. I only learned today that the app displayed two different texts during a calls."
1,"Bruh the channel update is sooo annoying! I use whatsapp because it's not like other media's but now you telling me to follow people on whatsapp?? And this option can't go away? Nah fam, act proper cause who was the target market for this update? I might as well use SMS it's so much simpler and i can communicate with friends. Facebook and Instagram is used to follow others, they have their own function so don't turn whatsapp into another Facebook and Instagram, can't have 3 of the same app."
1,The new update 13/9/23 of channel is worst I get random calls from random numbers on whatsapp inspite i haven't even joined any channels. The data is getting leaked somewhere.. phone numbers are miss used. We trust u with our data and u misuse it as and when required. It's a breach of our personal space and security. Why do u even need to add Chanel on personal WhatsApp as well .. we already have it in insta.. n that is enough for promoting. Very disappointed on security point of view
4,"The app is great overall. My suggestion to the owners is to add fun group activities. A variety of puzzle type activites initiated by group administrators that show the people in the group who solved the puzzle and the time taken by each person. This will no doubt increase interactions in the groups and take the popularity of the app to new heights. A lot of groups could do with some activity and personally, I wouldnt mind paying for some puzzles if that was an option."
1,"I've been using WhatsApp for a very long time.It has too many bugs.Picture quality is awful even in best quality mode.When you crop a video and post it,the video does not play properly on the users phone and the viewers phone and it's happening to multiple.It does this even when you send a cropped video to somebody.It jams like hell.When I am on video call and open camera,the camera switches off which is fine,tell me why I can't switch it back on after using my camera?I have to end the call firs"
5,"Excellent in all respects , very intuitive with brief capacities that no other can match. It's the best of all in the competitive apps. In similar market and capabilities."
4,"Well you only get 4-star rates because of 4 reasons. No.1 this app updates too much for me. No.2 Although it's Cool and all but it's a favorite App eater man i.e when updating you may have to delete most of your favorite Apps ‚òπÔ∏èüò≠ not COOL man, not COOL. No.3 After updating over and over again you may not be able to download voicemails and videos üòî Double Bummer. No.4 It takes too much space on the phone ( Most of the time I can't even open an App because of too much junk mostly from WhatsApp"
1,"Whatsapp is suddenly crashing everytime I open the app and tells me to download from Playstore even though it is installed from Playstore, I contact support via email but didn't get any help. Lost all contacts with my friends and family. Worst update ever."
1,"New emoji menu is extremely buggy, hard to navigate. Old menu was pretty good didnt take up much space and I can't fathom why you guys change it to this new buggy, counterintuitave UI. I know you wont revert it back at least patch the bug that happens %90 when i open the emoji menu, chat logs jumps up and emojis stay down"
1,"It was good till it lasted. Now my number keeps getting blocked every day for no reason, their automatic help support response blabbers about terms of use but they couldn't give me a reason of why my number keeps getting blocked. I barely use my phone and just need contact for some important contacts but this is unacceptable and annoying."
1,"I have been getting logged out and my account is getting block due to some reason. Everytime I mail you guys, I only get response that we are checking and you account will get active.  I want to know the reason behind it, it's almost been more than 10 years I am using whatsApp and all of sudden I am getting these error. Worst part is nobody give proper information regarding the issue. I am getting frequently banned and I am not able to use whatsApp as it requires minimum 24 hours to get active"
1,"If i ever wanted to access a specific status post of mine, i used to be able to access it individually with the 3 dots near ""My Status"". Now, with the new update, i need to scroll through all of my posts in order to get to a later post. As someone who posts often, this is a massive pain in the ---!"
3,"Decent and It's getting better but still far behind a app like telegram in terms of features , no games , no apps built in , no programmable bots , no chat groups , no feed only groups , telegram just does it all better .. take note meta ‚úåÔ∏è Trying to create a avitar doesn't work once you choose a skin tone it freezes and won't continue"
5,What's app is great! The best app by far for chatting and working conference calls video calls its gotvitvalk and you can be in the US and speak to someone in Hong Kong or London and it's like their next door you'll love it and it's un hackable which makes it even better try it you love it ! I've been using it for at the least 6 years now believe me hands down its the best app for this sort of stuff!
1,WhatsApp & its support system is WORST Not responding at all. No customer care number to fix the issues. My WhatsApp is not working since two months. It is asking for a pin for verification of my phone number. My number is working. But neither any sms or call has been provided from WhatsApp for the pin... It is causing me great inconvenience as all office messages and notifications are sent thru WhatsApp. Please do the needful or I will have to take aggressive steps to the court..
1,"Tried reading all info on using this app. I'm 62 years old and every paragraph describing whatsapp is a foreign language to me. I just want to know if my message was sent, and if it was received, but trying to understand the complicated instructions OMG. I WAS ASKED via an email to dm them on their whatsapp page and they gave me a number. So I downloaded the app and have never been so frustrated over trying to send a direct message."
1,"Dear WhatsApp You are losing your charm everyday. Don't make it complicated day by day, by giving unnecessary features,, already other apps are there to provide news and other stuffs. Request, kindly keep it simple like earlier. Or else,,the day is not very far .. when there will no distinction between WhatsApp and other social media apps..."
1,It's good chat and calling video calling and security etc. But I'm not satisfied with this feature transfer data that why I was to try my all data recovery so that doesn't recover with your this feature. plz try to backup is both options to backup data with cellular and wifi. Does connect with to cellular backup the data.
1,"Why are there so many bugs and problems on WhatsApp? i experienced a lot of bugs after i updated whatsapp. the snap has its duration cut off by itself, can't use gifs or stickers and many more. please fix it immediately. Thank you"
5,This is Angel father right now is whatsApp it's not working it keep saying that there is no data internet and he has and he can't call the family he is having trouble in calling throw the App. I have try everything on the phone and. Is phone is working because he makes regular calls and they go throw there is a problem in y'all app. Please could y'all try to see if is in y'all end. Thank you. P. S . The only way that it is working it's when I put the wifi
1,"I have some problems with the new emoji tray and I would like to share them. 1. It keeps bugging and it gives me a blank screen while my keyboard is up at the notification bar 2. When I go to the emojis and hold on the delete thing, I cant hold on it anymore and delete, now I have to continue pressing. 3. Not related to the emojis tray but I would like to ask why are status named updates now? Check our ratings because no one likes this update, I think yall would like to change it nowüòÄ thank you"
1,Since couple of weeks now i cannot share any video in the chat while my video format is matching up what is described on the whatsapp webpage. The best recommendation was to delete cash or reinstall the app. Nope this is bad programming. Kindly asking to increase the quality of the product again. Since i cleared app and reinstalled of course the restore stuck and fails on 20% so all my messages are lost.
3,Simple and Easy app for messaging. The new channel feature is good but it's copied from telegram but Good to see WhatsApp is also including more features like telegram to make it more useful and engaging but it still lacks a lot's of features as compared to telegram.
1,"Why on earth your team launched new ‚ÄúWhatsApp channel‚Äù features!? No need to turn WhatsApp into more likely Instragram!! Everyone was happy to connect with their friends and family members through this app, it was doing it's job greatly until the new trash update came!! Please keep WhatsApp as it was before, for friends family and business, to some extent.I'm personally very much disappointed with this, and after using WhatsApp more than 7 years now I think I'll have to uninstall it."
4,"From last 3 to 4 months there is a problem to update About. When we updae an about from phone's clipboad and paste the text, the process of updating is show but after some time this error show that- Couldn't upadte About.Try again. Pls solve this problem. I also update my whatsapp but this problem is not solved."
3,"It's a great app. There is only one thing that has to be fixed immediately: when you open a voice message, it always stops before the end and it is frustrating. Is Zuckerberg not aware of that. That has been a problem for many years and it hasn't received any attention appearantly."
1,I'm using WhatsApp as i got Android mobile (2015) but still now it's not improving the picture and video quality to be share with friends even the picture in the document format. The picture quality in original format will be reduced that the pixels not clearly seen. I strongly condemned this feature must be updated in the new update!
5,"To the Whatsapp team: Thank you very much for allowing me to use this amazing tool that revolutionized the way that people comunicate. Sometimes many forget that they aren't paying nothing for this, but they are saving thousands of money....And aren't humble to ASK, they just COMPLAIN. I'm here asking please if you can check why after the last update, the writing box is jumping to the top of my mobile screen when i intend to insert an emoji, sticker etc. Thank you so much."
1,"Verification! There's two hours of my life I will never get back....I couldn't use SMS, because my provider (Telstra) in their wisdom, yesterday, gave me a different number just for SMS. My Samsung blocks spam calls, apparently WhatsApp is spam, turn that off, try again, get the call, no keypad, find the keypad, too late. Please try again in two hours. Please WhatsApp, test your verification process properly, not just with Apple phones."
3,"Anytime I reply to a message on a group chat or any chat at all, it takes me to the end of the chat. It's really annoying because I'd have to be scrolling up a lot. Can Whatsapp please work on this immediately? It shouldn't be taking me to the end of the chat. I remember that it wasn't like that before, what happened? It's getting really annoying not gonna lie"
1,"I used to have what's up app since long ago but since while I start to have a big problem,It need so long time to send short videos and photos, really I don't know why I have normal phone with strong internet,so I don't recommend it anymore for any one ,so if you can help me to resolve this problem I would be thankful , üòîüòîüòîüòîüòî,I was thinking maybe the problem in my phone but I tried other phone still the same problems,to text someone i don't have problems only with sending very short video"
1,"The recent update keeps on having glitches. When I press the emojis after writing the message, they don't appear immediately. They will only do so after I have sent the message. Sometimes I have to go out then come back again to see the message."
2,"Chat transfer, at first see this as a great function. Yet, WITH it's BUGS and ERRORS, years of chat media n backup gone in second. Even when I put back the backup copy I had, current WhatsApp just keep on wiping yr ""media"" everytime u log into. Frustrated, devastated. It's better this function nvr released, I still can recover or use the old way to transfer my chat and backup. Good bye to old backups, to anyone who wanna login WhatsApp to another phone, u better pray ""no error"" in the process."
1,The text box randomly obscures both the text I'm busy writing AND the latest message while I'm typing Moving the GIF menu from the bottom to the top in the text options the was an awful UI choice; I don't ever use gifs and way preferred it when sliding left to right would take you through the emoji tabs instead of moving to GIFs
1,"New WhatsApp update is a complete disaster. Are you guys trying to make it like Instagram or Facebook? Why are you adding option to follow different channels and personalities in status section? Don't forget it, This is not a social media app, its a messaging app. Try to keep it for messaging purpose only."
3,"Very useful and handy, yet it still needs some improvements. Also, it should give users more controls like on the interface and text styles management to name few."
2,Overall liked this app for quite a long time. But from last 1 month facing problem. 1. In my mobile I have 3 different mail IDs saved. But mobile contact is synchronised for only 1 I'd. But in WhatsApp I can see other contacts whichs are saved on other I'd. Sometime same mobile no is occurring with different names in WhatsApp. Continue refresh but problem is not resolved.
1,The Worst App ever I have using... every time when I used to update chat backup app will not responding. App Data which is more than 7 GB. I cant able to update chat backup more than 3 months. Ebery time it shows please wait a moment... it shows until I close the app & open it next time.... the Worst app.
3,"I don't understand why WhatsApp is trying to become the new Facebook..The ""Channels"" option, I hate it...I liked WhatsApp because it was kinda personal..u added people u actually knew!! Now they introduced a channels feature which constantly pops up and u don't even get the choice to remove it! If this continues I might have to switch to some other messaging app."
1,"Due to latest update for ""Updates"" tab at place of ""status"" edit option is Removed, which was really very helpful, to see our specific status which we posted, but in this latest update option button is removed. also please enable option to delete multiple Statuses which we have posted on WhatsApp status because it's hard to delete status if you want to. Thanks in advance"
4,The app is very nice. but require a feature to keep a status for specific group like broadcast list. Like only specific group people can see a specific status. e.g. School Teacher wants to inform about tomorrows lectures then he/she should able keep status for students only not for all contacts.
1,Updated the app yesterday and unable to use gifs anymore because it's getting stuck and hence unable to scroll. Even the search option in gifs is also not good anymore as it is not showing related searches anymore. It was awesome previously but now it's the worst.
2,Watch app needs a lot of work. For some reason all notifications show up with the same first message on top (2 weeks ago) and then I have to click on it to open and scroll down to find the new message that the notification was trying to show me in the first place... ugh
2,"Screen sharing is good, but I can't get sound from a third party app .. let's say I want to lecture or show a video to my classmates the video plays without sound on the receiving end"
2,"Since last few weeks, the status images are not loading properly and are blurred. The same is happening with the sent chat images. They are not opening and are blurred. Please look into this asap."
2,"the recent updates makes voice message playback impossible. Whenever play button is pressed the phone goes into ""phone"" mode immediately with screen blacked out and sound unauditable. Pixel 5 latest Android."
3,Loving the new customisation features Could I add a few like decreasing the picture compression when sending one Or having a profile Pic with multiple images that you swipe through And fix the bug where you go on ur pc archive a locked chat and can view it on archive on your phone There's an issue where your screen switches off while listening to VNs
3,Overall I'm happy with this app. I'm not impressed that the quality is compressed lowering the standard of quality and not even allowing an option to change my setting on picture quality setting which we checked on Iphones that do have this options.
3,Dear what's app team hopefully you will find this feedback. Now we won't be able to save contact number from direct what's app and those recently added contacts aren't visible in the what's app and one more this most important there is no refresh option in the settings. Is there any chance to rectify this problem
3,The new emoji interface was not so friendly as compared to the older one. This new interface with some transition effects on opening is getting laggy sometimes.Hope this will be fixed!
3,"Not used it a huge amount, but seems good. 4th Sept 2023. The search for gifs is now broken for me. As soon as I try to scroll the results it displays the default set of gifs again."
1,"Their support group is really unhelpful. I have tried to reach them, and all I recieve are automatic answers from them. I am afraid I lost all off my data, media and files from WhatsApp, because of their reluctance to help."
2,The UI needs to be more bolder. The dark theme should be more amoled. The contact syncing needs to be fixed as it duplicates even after refreshing contact list. It would be 5 stars but whatsapp has become very glitchy and unreliable at times.
1,"The new emoji keyboard is so annoying. And also when i chat its message interface is so distrubing, there creates a space and i can't see the last msg. The previous version is soo good then this new annoying version üòë."
4,"Can I say I absolutely adore the new updates on the app, but I would like to suggest the pages having comment sections under each posts, videos and lots, each chat tabs having access to call scheduling, and I being able to create an update account as a regular person and not as someone influencial, the regular people don't have access to creating update accounts, keep it up developers and please consider my suggestions, (it's like Whatsapp is about to be the new go-to-app)."
3,"It's a great app but my only problem right now is the quality when I upload a picture(s) or video(s). Why does it downgrade the quality and have it looking trashy?ü•≤ if I upload a pic or vid in 10/10 quality, I expect the app to keep the quality, you know? Just something to think about for a future update. It would be greatly appreciatedü´∂üèΩüôèüèΩ"
4,"The time for video in story is too short. Make it 2 or 3 minutes atleast. Secondly, the quality of the photo, atleast make it in such a way that one can choose the quality he want to send. It's kinda boring sometimes the way the pictures looked after you make a post"
1,"From the Last update, the service have ruined the app. My account was getting banned without any valid reason. At morning, the problem got fixed, but, at the evening, it again got banned. I always have to write a review to fix this. So please fix this problem, otherwise I will uninstall the app."
5,"To be honest the app is really good. But you really need to work on your photos and videos upload quality. It just ruins everything and that's kind of a let down being my favorite app. OTHER ADDITIONS AREN'T REALLY RELEVANT. PLEASE FIX YOUR UPLOAD QUALITY, IT WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTERüò≠"
3,Lately I'm experiencing problems with voice messaging. When I try to listen to a message play button just doesn't work... For the first time I'm wondering if it's time to start using telegram.
2,"Cannot perform search in Infinix Note 12 VIP. In order phones the search function in WhatsApp is very responsive but it's not so in Infinix Note 12 VIP. When you type a letter in the search box, (whether in with a particular contact/group chat or the entire WhatsApp), you won't notice any search result list. You have to close the app several times and re-inititate the search task before you can see a search result."
1,I hate new interface and features. I only want to see my private contacts. I don't care about channels. Bring back old interface or give me option to hide the new interface. That's all. Thank you.
1,"This app is the worst app I have ever seen. I am trying to open this app since July but upto it didn't open. I can't use whatsapp. Whenever, I am opening the app it's showing you need the official account to use the app.But from Last two years I am using this number only. So please help me to open whatsapp. There are many Information in it. Please help"
3,"The experience is not cool this year. Some contacts shows only their number even after saving in the phonebook. That's why i gave 3 star , except this issue the app is functioning just wow. Need to introduce new features related to privacy settings. Chatlock feature is only working with systum lock this woud have to change so any password can i try instead of system lock"
2,"The date for the texts have been messing up a lot For example instead of it saying ""today""it says Tuesday or it says march 21 2011 or 1969 or 1970 and it's getting annoying since I've cleared data a few times after clearing the data it worked well for an hour then it started malfunctioning again please fix this When someone calls me it takes ages for it to connect"
3,"This new ""updates"" feature sucks tbh, don't found it any interesting and I think that this app should remain for what is meant for, it's not going to be any better than Twitter/Instagram/Facebook in terms of catching up with your favorite artists/content creators updates, and you can't see your muted contacts status which it's kinda ???"
3,It's ok.but I have a little problem with the app.it deleted all my contacts in the app leaving the numbers behind.i can't view statuses and no one can view mine either .it's a frustrating experience and there's no one to help me fix it
5,Wonderful! But it would be more spectacular if you add a feature to send offline messages As many times and most of us not stays online so if this feature comes then it might be helpful for us. This will make the application a universal message for all
2,"Recently, I am having trouble with my new whatsapp contacts. Although the new contacts have a whatsapp account, they are not shown in my whatsapp list. In other words, my whatsapp contacts are not synced with my phone contacts. Unfortunately, this is getting so annoyoing! I hope it gets fixed soon!"
1,My experience is very bad because there is no body means no customer support for any problem. I don't know what is your terms and conditions. My account has been band without giving any reason or notice. I submitted my application to whatsapp official but there is no support. #meta
2,"I don't like the new update on redesigned stickers tray üò† It confused me whenever I choose any recent stickers to be sent and it always goes back to the original category and is slower, blinking for about 0.1 seconds before message sent, very annoying. Please get back to the basic mode before update."
1,Bad update .... Was not required at all ... Status bar first allowed us to see individual fresh photo that we uploaded ... Now we have to check all status uploaded to see the last one ... Why do you guys make simple things complicated ? Who at all passes such bakwas ideas ? Why did you feel that channels were at all required ?
2,What's with the WhatsApp error I keep getting that deletes weeks of my messages even when I tap on restore and wait for it to hit 100%? Three weeks worth of messages gone cause of an error I have no hand in? You guys have the worst backup system. One small error and you lose your messages and files forever.
2,"The worst part is when it gives error of restore chat history. I always loose my chat history in this process. It doesn't restore all my chat history and in result I always loose my recent chats and documents. Telegram is awesome in this context. Team, fix this issue."
1,"I downloaded the application and it has refused to Open or it keeps closing. I don't know what the problem is this time,as I updated the old version to a new one. I crave your indulgence to find a long lasting solution. The implication of this is that I don't have access to my WhatsApp account anymore as it closes anytime I open it. Please do something about this üôè"
1,"There is a universal glitch on incoming voice WhatsApp call , incoming WhatsApp call is not getting notified. Kindly see to it. Secondly , kindly remove 'channels' feature on WhatsApp . By adding channels , it's just a sister concern of Instagram. WhatsApp , by default , is meant for personalized chats , not for following someone , like on other social media platforms. By addition of 'channels' feature, WhatsApp will eventually lose its individuality."
1,"I am facing an issue where the camera is getting stuck while switching from front to back while video calling between 3-10 min ,this happens quite often and I thought it's the phone issue but after getting its software updated again and again, I can clearly say that no other video calling app apart from what's app is having this issue so please team @WhatsApp please look into this issue as the help section is of no use."
1,Banning the numbers which are legit and never used any 3rd party apps. Only used WhatsApp from Google Play Store. And your contact support is also useless no help. All bot replies . My job have encountered many problems because of your silly mistake . If your system us unable to detect which number or device ever used Unofficial app or then better delete that program.
5,"Exquisite experience up until now, I don't think there's any instant communication app will ever come close, so innovative ideas as I'm a person who so inlove with improvement and change, I like to adapt to new ways new things and learn and WhatsApp is one of the best when it comes to that, I've just saw a Mark Zuckerberg video regarding the channels, so excited to see"
3,"Good app for messaging, but uploading & downloading media is bad. The image & video quality is worse. The same goes for the story. The quality is bad that you can't even see the face. Lol, it's 2023, but still cannot post in HD."
2,"Let me start off by saying that love using whatsapp but there's too many unnecessary and useless updated features on the app and it's causing the app to have to many faults and i just can't with it anymore..in my opinion you guys should remove all these nonsense you've been putting on the app and update it with stuff that makes much more sense and that people will gravitate to more, like longer videos on status please do take this into consideration."
1,"This new version has broken the chat placement, new chats sometimes don't automatically jump to the top of the list, like they used to. It's very annoying to be honest, having to search for a recent chat in spite of just sending messages to it recently."
1,"I have been awaiting a verification code since the 31st of August to reset the app on a number I have had for many years to no avail. All emails and texts to the support staff have been a waste of time, and the timeline keeps extending."
5,"WhatsApp is the best app for text, voice and video messaging, video calls and posting of statuses. It is usually updated from time to time with exceptional features. I highly recommend for anyone and everyone."
4,"Hello sir, if u have a time, please consider putting the ""signout"" function into whatapps like other apps.. Thank you, sir.. Everything will be okay, but if the signout function has been developed, it ll be excellent, sir. And sir, if u want to improve for people who do a small business. Can u develop like a ig story that can do a poll / voting by post a status"
5,"One cannot be without WhatsApp. It's excellent to communicate with friends and families. When having groups to join, it can be used for advertising what you do and what you or another person can help with. It really has many functions"
3,"Whoever advised y'all to remove the SEARCH BUTTON from the Status/Updates section? üòí You cannot have me scrolling endlessly to find a status update to view. It makes zero sense. Besides thisüëÜüèº, your app is great to use."
1,Worst app....it's 2 way verification is more worst comparatively security purpose. There is no working backup plan even with genuine one. Even it has no customer helpline number. It's backup account reset is much much lengthy and hektik like 7 day you can't connect with others. Not even show which email I'd is associated with owner account üòïüòïüòï.....
1,"Worst update!!!! Please restore the previous update and keep the status interface as it was before, like we could copy, and tapping on three dots of my status, could see any individual status."
4,"WhatsApp is great application for conversession video & audio call. But WhatsApp has to add one more feature account management like telegram. In Telegram, you can login to one account in many places. You can use Telegram Web or Add New Account to manage multiple accounts. This is a great feature that must come in WhatsApp.In screen sharing, the person watching the screen should not see the video call pop-up. Then he can see the full screen. Thankyou WhatsApp Team üëç"
1,Best way to connect with people individually along with best security. Of course it's difficult to contact someone without saving contact number. Other than that it's a very good app.
1,This new version is messed up. Ever since I updated mine I have not been able to see status upload from my contacts for the past four days now even in stable internet connection. What could be the issue??? Please fix it up
1,"It's a poor app as since i have updated it, i nolonger use it. It doesnot operate at all but it keeps me registering myself though even the registration doesnot reach the end. I have been offline for a couple of days because all apps of whatsapp redirect me to this app, that's really annoying."
3,I haven't had a single issue with Whatsapp since 2014 but now you guys removed the setting to select upload quality so now Everytime I send something it's always sent as HD despite selecting SD. Not sure how to fix it.
1,"I don't write a review more but this time this is too much how can your system apologize me for the same mistake more than four times literally your system did the same mistake 4 times omg so disappointing. As I have created international friends group they have provided me their phone number so I can add them but when I select 4/5 numbers at once to add in the group it simply bans my account and when I requested for the review it tells ""it was the system mistake"" plz fix it üò≠ #humble request"
4,"I love the message yourself update, but can be better if you add time at which the message can show. Ie I can message myself and ask it to show a later time, when the message shows up at that time then it becomes a reminder. But now when I message myself it immediately comes into the inbox alread read, other messages will come later and I might forget the importance of the message I sent to myself. Just add a time button to it and it's perfect."
1,"THEIR IS A BUG ,In settings->Privacy ->Last seen and online ->My contact except ..... this option is not working in WhatsApp when I give permission to one contact then he can only see my last seen but it is not working it only work when both user give the permission to each other user then only it work then it showing the last seen to another user but in this case both user can see last seen of each other. Which is not correct according to the working policy of this feature.It's a BUG!!!!!"
1,"Seriously I don't even understand why are there such useless updates in this app. Its just like they change the formate everytime... it's hard for one, when you are using the app for a long time and an unusual format kicks in which doesn't even make that much sense.."
1,"Getting error while opening the WhatsApp application, maybe bug. On tapping on WhatsApp icon, opening UI appear after which the chat list appear for less than 1 seconds and app immediately closes(maybe crash) and my mobile home page appears on screen. Plz take this into look and consider it to resolve at earliest. However WhatsApp web is working fine."
4,"It's a good app and it's easy to use but some features are forced on us to use these should be optional for users like channels, I personally don't like to use channels in WhatsApp but as it is already there and so we can't remove it by our own choice."
5,"WhatsApp is best app text, voice, video and messaging, video call posting of statuses. It is very useful updated from time to time. But I like it the most for the audio calls. I highly recommend for everyone."
3,"Everything is going well, only updates are getting late in this and there should also be marketing in this and I want to join the beta which is not happening to me. Except to be done I am having this issue beta version is still installed. you might want to uninstall and install this app"
3,Dear meta management all over app is good but some bugs please change the status upload the quality of status are automatically compressing and decreasing quality of pics and videos please roll out a feature that we have able to upload status in higher quality please change it... And some times messages are not delivered to others some crashes taking place... üòï
5,Overall is a good app. Can't complain about too much at all. Spam has started to creep in lately in the form of people from employment services/ recruitment agencies but besides that all good.
4,"Long videos cannot be sent. There must be a feature on WhatsApp where long videos (upto 50GB) can be sent. WhatsApp, kindly try to upload the above feature. Otherwise it's the best."
5,"We have a small group whose edit group settings we changed a few days before, Now some of my team members were saying that because of this setting change, they were not able to send messages in the group. Can you explain us ? If we edit group settings, this issue can be occur due to group settings changed..?"
5,"Dear devs eventhough the option of disappearing messages are useful for some people,its really a painful option when someone uses it for a group where other members may need to keep the contents and photo.(i know there is an option to select and keep some photos but still when u need every detail shared in a group or with someone it is really difficult) please do something so that disappearing messages can be a private solution that applies only in that particular persons phone and not for all"
1,"Why there is no search option like apple when we tap an hold the app, this allows us to search a contact without entering the app. This feature is in the iOS app but not in the Android. Very disappointing"
4,"Let us choose if we want *status* to load automatically or not. The data usage is unbearable for me as I have many contacts. Also, My deleted contacts are still showing on WhatsApp even after refreshing my contacts list. Please fix that. Thanks."
5,"I love the way this app keeps everything confidential and private. You can also send voice messages, pictures and videos! I never knew that. Very Impressed, Thank you so much my brother for introducing me to this wonderful app.üòò"
2,"I'm no fan of this app. I use it because I have to. It's not tremendously bad, but recently I noticed that I don't get any notifications unless I open it, usually after someone let me know via other apps that they sent a message. I wonder if this has anything to do with the fact that there's a setting ""popup notification"" not available ""because of my version of Android""??? So according to you, for the app to work decently I need to buy a new phone?"
1,"Not happy with updated version with channels and all annoying things. That's not in our hands that we could change it, so i request you for previous version."
3,"1. Can't share or forward image, content, or messages if it's locked üòï 2. Introduce user-friendly AI like Snapchat does 3. Introduce schedule messaging like Samsung does 4. Introduce many clipping&cutting features so that the user can cut as many as the area he wants. It avoids the usage of cropping tools, hence done within the app ."
1,"So many bugs, like while I m scrolling onto a conersation, often it suddenly drops down in conversation or goes up, skipping other messages. Sometimes I don t receive some messages from a contact and the contact sent me. It is lagging and also, after let s say 2 weeks, you can t download pictures that someone sent you on the group or privately. Whatsapp was the best ..."
5,The app is continuously improving the features. But it banned my account though I have not violated any terms of service. Repeated requests is replied by help centre that there is no issue with account. But in reality I get the message that the account is banned whenever I try to open my WhatsApp.
3,Not very fond of the app but it's okay to use. One main annoying problem I have is that the app keeps creating backup files that takes up space even after I've turned off the create backup setting. Please fix this problem. Thank you
1,"Unfortunately the latest update has become a bit of an annoyance. It keeps glitching and would go completely out of the app whilst I'm typing, which then I'd have to restart my whole phone just to send a text message."
1,"Rating 1 stars for privacy invasion, I'm getting spam messages from all over the businesses I've never signed up for... With their promotional ads. This is annoying. First FB then insta and now WhatsApp. Zuckerberg invading privacy everywhere. Only using this app since there's lot of ppl on this app and same contacts you won't find on other platforms. I hate this channels thing which comes under status. New layout of emojis is bad."
4,"The app is great. I love the new features like the edit, video note and so on... But I'll like if you'll bring back the clarity of pictures and videos on statuses. Thank you"
1,"The new update has been more worse than previous one. When i video call with someone, always pop out try to get better signal. This is very annoying. Because my line/network are good speed. Please take an action for this. And i will rate to 5 star. Thank you"
2,The channels update is just horrible and makes the whole app annoying to use. Why can it not be activated as per individual preference? It really is unwanted and so unnecessary.
2,"The application is truly impressive, yet despite its abundance of features, it disappointingly lacks the functionality to export multiple files. When I receive numerous documents or images that require sharing in different apps or saving in goole drive, I am left with no choice but to save them individually and then attach/save each one separately. I kindly request your attention to this matter, as it would greatly enhance the user experience. Thank you for your consideration."
2,"For communications, the app is fine. The redesign of the notification icon, which displays the sender's profile image, is a terrible idea. The previous icon was immediately recognizable. The current choice is dependent on there being contrast between the image and the background, which the developers cannot possibly guarantee. As a result, the icon for many of my contacts just looks like a smudge. In my opinion, this design choice is horribly flawed."
2,"Voice clips aren't sending. They get recorded and I can see them but they fail to upload regardless of my network and restarts don't fix anything. There are contacts for which this happens and contacts that,are fine. It seems arbitrary. Furthermore, it used to be that i could play a voice clip in a long string of voice clips, open a different app and listen to them all in the background. Now it sometimes stops at the end of one message even if there's more to play."
3,"One frustrating aspect of WhatsApp is the various limitations it imposes. For example, when sending videos or music, the file names are changed to random strings instead of retaining their original names. Additionally, image compression can significantly reduce the quality of photos. Furthermore, the 90-second limit for sending videos can be inconvenient at times."
3,"I use the app a lot and it works! The newer updates only allow the sharing of one file at a time using the file sharing option unlike the older versions. It is frustrating trying to share a big number of files, selecting them all only to send one after hitting the share button. Please fix, or tell me if there's something that needs to be set up in-app."
1,"After updating to the latest version of this app,I cant download voice notes, videos, pictures,my videos,pictures,files and other documents no longer delivers. At first I thought it's data but even after subscribing it's still the same. It's frustrating,I only send typed messages. I can't listen to group voice note anymore cause I can't download them no matter what!! Please treat as urgent!"
1,It was so easy to slide between tabs with left or right swipe. I had been using that feature for years and when you change the top tab to bottom and remove that feature. It is like taking 1 step back than a new feature. Now it is difficult for me to take the chat screen after viewing status on my note series. So I stopped opening status page itself so that I don't have to switch back. I usually keep frequently used items close to right side but not asking for that. At least retain the swipe.
5,‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èAmazing I know its just a messaging app but it's great! You can call video call group chats! I love ‚ù§Ô∏è being in gcs with my friends. This is probably an app you should Install. 1 bug is that on a video call the other person is VERY laggy and there voice sometimes to then it disconects so I have to re-call but apart from that it's very good üòÅ
3,Most people won't want the channels function that came with the new update. There should be an option to remove it or at least completely hide it. Terrible addition.
3,"This app was great but it's getting worst now,If I cut a video from the middle to the end for my status, It will start from the beginning to the end when I post it,you gotta improve and fix this problem."
2,"There are some problems with voice message. Whenever I turn on a voice message, the screen of the phone automatically get switched off and I can't hear anything though the message keeps running"
1,"The new update is wack, the emojies are constantly shifting, the delete button is no where to be found. Who decided, hey let's make their lives difficult with this update? What was the reason. If you'd please return things back to normal, my rating would go higher. Fellow users, if you don't want stress don't be like me downloading the new update, it's a nightmare I tell you."
2,"It keeps stopping since the last update. The quality of the sent and received photos is the worst. Also, the filters that are supposed to improve the photo quality, make it much worse.. Not to forget about sending videos, which is another challenge. Either to cut the video because of its size, or sending a very short one. In both conditions the quality is meh."
1,"I don't understand why I can't log in with my number anymore, it keeps saying I have to log in with an official whatsapp and I have been doing that, for the past 2 weeks now it has refused to verify my number... This is quite unfair and embarrassing as I have business to attend to pending because I have been offline, I have contacted support, but still no results yet. This is annoying. Kindly fix this."
5,"This app is cool ,reliable and easy to use. I'm using it from 2 years and I have face no problem but sometimes it frustrated me. Another request is that , please improve it video call . For Example . if someone chat on video call her face look beautiful and cool Beauty Camera used in the video call ."
1,"Am finding it difficulty in making WhatsApp calls, I will not be hearing clearly, cracking and breaking down. After this update I don't really understand what is happening again, you can not make calls, voice massages problem. please update the app is interesting anymore."
5,Free app with privacy protection. It is good for a secured conversation. I like it. But it will be good if option for permission will be introduced to the app to help someone to accept or deny some invitation to a group he/she is not interested in. Thank you.
4,Was good platform with only messaging n call. New update not seems good as it loses its privacy and confidentiality. It's my suggestion that we have Facebook n Instagram having all features of a channel...
2,"There is a bug in UI, when I try to scroll up to see filters after selecting an image to send. It does not work properly, filters pannel is partially visible and difficult to select. Im using redmi 8A dual, android 10"
1,I have had issues connecting to groups with a new phone. I sent a message to support and was informed I was using an unofficial version and was given a link to the Google app store's WhatsApp which is the same I have. I messaged them again to inform them. They replied with the same message and closed the chat. This app is useless when you change devices and don't have your chats backed up.
1,After switching phones I lost crucial videos and chats as the transfer of data failed. I also could not use the app on the old device due to it only working on one device at a time. This is awful.
3,"There should be an option that gives choice of storage to be used,some phones have small storage capacity.. I will love it when it goes that way, because with telegram you can choose to use internal or external storage to keep yourself going but with this app if the storage is full unless you delete many things on your device before it will work"
1,"I have given a low rating this is all because of very low status quality. I haved make a video with my phone with 1080p quality and when i had upload on WhatsApp as a status, it will turned to low quality (fully cracked quality). Ill be appreciate your this act of kindness if you'll work on that problem. Thanks."
3,please add an option 'original quality' that would be greatüëç Edit: the newest update for channel is great but there is no more the list of status which you can copy the caption of your status and i always spam videos n smtimes there is a particular video i want to watch but such a bother to watch my whole status so i just go to the list of all my status n just watch from there. But now the feature is gone!‚òπ
1,"The new version messed up everything. Today the app refused to open saying that the current version was very old. When I updated it and opened the app I found that it had deleted everything, including photos, documents AND the BACKUPS. now I can't restore my past messages. Otherwise it is a good app."
5,Plz add a feature that we can delete broadcast messages for everyone. After today's updation 15.09.23 we r unable to see particular status view like if we have update 2 or more pictures in our status but we want to see view of 3rd one picture directly then now that feature is not available. Kindly update it.
4,"This app need to be able to use the wide angle mode in the camera inside WhatsApp. To save time when you are trying to send wide angle photos to people. And the video mode need to support HD or 4K. The WhatsApp video call is great, but I wish it had screen sharing such as FaceTime zoom Microsoft teams. Google meet"
1,Pictures and videos quality is compromised to the point that they are completely ruined during compressed when uploaded. Some videos even lose sound. Setting upload quality to high didn't solve the problem.
3,"Recently I am facing an issue so I'm reporting it 3 star cz whenever I want to put 1 video of 3,4 minutes I make segments of 30/30 seconds which are apparently looking good but whenever I post this and I am going to see them is it okay ? Then I always see a 1,2 seconds gap which is not my fault this is application fault please remove this fault and aslo add feature of putting video of more than 30 seconds on status"
5,"WhatsApp is one of the most important social platforms nowadays. Through which people from all over the world are connected with each other. This is especially a boon for those whose immediate family members have gone abroad for livelihood. For them, the services of platforms like WhatsApp are commendable. We are very grateful to the founders of WhatsApp and its management for making things easier for people by introducing new features. Thanks again"
1,"What happens to being able to select my own status?Now i have to press one by one and it's annoying,now i can't even forward multiple status at once or delete multiple status,why?? please just bring it back (Previous review:Please increase the status video duration that can be send to at least 45 seconds,30 seconds is too short for me)"
3,"New update is getting worst. Firstly, the search status feature is gone now and the colour when people don't have profile picture makes it looks ugly ( in the group especially). Secondly, there's a bug too. There will be a delay when we send a message to community while I don't have any internet connection problem. Developer should let us edit text too in community. Hope developer can fix this problem immediately"
4,I don't like this update at all. What's the point of Changing keyboard features. Bottom bar is on the top of the keyboard now. I'm using whatsapp from years and my hand automatically move in set pattern for everything and it is so inconvenient for me.
5,Whatsapp is currently on a different level... I wonder how they did it though.. One thing I've noticed these few years is the fact that the first application software that an individual would always install on a newly acquired phone is always whatsapp ... Congratulations and thanks for bridging the gaps between nations.... All the best.... Ciao Bella
4,"Great. . . However. I'm trying to delete a couple contacts but they won't delete. . . I've followed everything. Deleted from my phones contacts, and also delete through the WhatsApp app, refreshed contacts and turn my phone on and off. And they still there. Its really irritating. . ."
2,Used to be a very good messaging app where I could share everything (even my personal data). But now this is gonna be an open social media platform like Insta and Facebook where my data isn't safe anymore. Becoming a trash day by day. What's the need of those channels? why should I follow those while I have Insta and FB to follow already? Useless updates üëéüëéüëé
2,It stuck some time like when restore backup I choosed to use wifi and it say it will wait to connect wifi then I wanted to change it to mobile data but it didn't allowed and I have to reinstall whole app and again when I share a FB real as status it stucked again won't allow me open it I restarted my phone then reinstall this app ü•πü•πü•π
1,"WhatsApp has always positioned itself as a secure platform, emphasizing end-to-end encryption for messages and calls. However, the introduction of screen sharing opens up a new avenue for potential breaches. Users might unintentionally or unknowingly share sensitive information, passwords, or personal content during video calls. I hope, WhatsApp needs to further address the security concerns to ensure that this innovation doesn't compromise the privacy that its users hold dear."
5,Great way to keep in touch with family and friends!!! Easy to use and now the new additions like editing and reminders that you can send yourself!!! Really great! Congratulations to the designer/s.
3,Good' I found a Bug still when sending Images more than years. While taking Images in Mobile Camera it's good. But while adding photos in status or sending to other person images quality is not clear. Quality of the image brakes. Kindly work on it.
2,"I hate that new ""channels"" thing. It is really unnecessary. Whatsapp is supposed to be for communication with family and friends and for private connections. This update will make it not different than tweeter or insta or whatever. I have no need for that channels thing.. please make it possible to disable it at least. It looks so ugly, and it is useless for me as I will never use it."
4,"I'm glad what you've been doing with this app, continuously updating and adding useful features. Although I would recommend that you add options for read receipts as you have for status, profile picture, last seen, etc. The one where you can choose who'd be aable to get your read receipts like everybody ,just your contacts, contacts except few people or nobody at all. It would be really helpful üò∏"
4,"Everyone knows this app is great. They have to make a feature in status by which we can make groups in stsus privacy, so that we can select which group of our contacts can see our status. For example if I want my status to be seen only to my school friends most of the time, I should have a group in status privacy section where I can select it and post the status. If not every time I'll have to select the people I want my status to be seen among 1000 of my contacts which is tedious"
1,"The app is okay. But why make the new features similar with the one of Instagram, I mean if I want channels I could easily go to Instagram. The new update is wack and at this point it's better to uninstall the app and rather be on X cause why make both apps have similar features, just doesn't make sense. The app is already good on it's own, tsk tsk at this point Whatsapp keeps getting boring and the best you guys can come up with is this new features!???"
1,"Have been trying to access my account since I lost my phone so I had to buy a new one,but they telling me to use the app that I registered with the first time and it's actually this one but still it refuses to openy account.Really frustrating and annoying to me."
2,"Every update WhatsApp sends out causes previously received photos and videos to download into my media gallery. I've changed internal settings so media is not supposed to download to my gallery. Yet still, every update that is installed from WhatsApp means I have to spend time deleting a bunch of old media that is auto dumped into my gallery lest it suck up all of my storage."
2,The new sticker tray update is really terrible. Now you can't switch sticker groups seamlessly like before but have to wait until the app scrolls all the way down to the group you select. If something works already don't touch it.
3,"There are a few skirmishes on the app that need improvement. Unlike Paysenger App which has superb interface, easy navigation and well tailored icons."
1,"Was better before the update, now update has slowed the app down when typing messages, accessing emojis used to be smooth, it's now slow and tedious, and slows down my message typing significantly, would rather just not use emojis at this point. I also get multiple bugs when exiting a chat after typing a message. Didn't think the app needed an update? Why move things around when everyone is used to the positions. Delete button on emoji keyboard had no reason to be moved? So buggy"
3,"It is a great and good app for talking and messaging with others, but the only problem is that when we share a video in our Status, the quality of the video deteriorates a lot. Do not spoil the quality of the video"
1,The channels are so lame. I'll stick to telegram anyday. Well ahead of WhatsApp. More advanced features than WhatsApp has. WhatsApp is way slow and the calls aren't the best. Sound quality can be a problem.
2,"I have been using whatsapp for long time because of its simplicity, but i really dislike the recent update on the channel version. It look so messy & i cant turned it off. Would love it if there is a setting that can enable & disable the channel"
1,"Remove the update part, formal status part is good. I don't wnat to see any unwanted channel or anything in whatsapp. Now if i want to see muted ,i have to go to three button and then muted status...... I would like the previous status format. Now a day Whatsapp is bringing unwanted update that don't want to have that."
1,"The edit option should be easier to acces. the amount of time I have to use it, it would be easier if there was an edit icon on top or next to the emojies."
1,"new update with the emoji/sticker layout is so frustrating to use. everything is moved around and after adding an emoji to my message, the box moves so I can't even see what I'm typing afterwards. what a horrible idea"
3,"It will be great if whatsapp also works as a todo app, like todo for self and todo(ie assigning tasks) to others..this is much needed since every person have a different app for their todo so collaborating becomes difficult but whatsapp is used by all so it can act as a common todo...like in the chat where this is ""media"" ""link"" there can be anothet section ""todo"" which would be basically tasks related to that person...what he gave to me and vice versa."
1,"I'm really annoyed by the channels in the status menu. They're cluttering up my screen and I don't need them. I hope the developers will add an option to turn them off in the next update. Otherwise, I'm done with this app."
3,"Guys, please can you give ability to disable channels or the entire updates tab? I'm trying to practise better tech health and remove myself from the idea of companies trying to keep me 'engaged' with their brand (read: waste away my life online, and my money to them). For a messaging app, it seems quite dark that you'd support this underhand way of marketing, and not necessary given the multitude of other apps doing this already."
2,"The last seen and online settings have been very irritating for me lately. The "" my contacts except"" feature isn't working properly as it shows me last seen even of the people I've excluded. I hope this problem is fixed soon."
2,"Hello there, WhatsApp need to update some changes like... when we write a paragraph or long messages it's not showing the whole para in our chat box untill we sent it. I'm unable to see my long messages and showing a blank box and sometimes message box use to disappear. hence, have a cross check with tester and developer and solve this problem"
2,the new update makes the emoji/sticker section open just a little at the bottom. i have to drag the section up each time i want to use emojis/stickers. the sticker packs now too are arranged in a weird way such that they scroll everytime between the sticker packs unlike the earlier 'sticker pack tabs'. Team kindly look into it and fix it as early as possible
4,"I'm using WhatsApp since a couple of years. It's easiest way to send any type of software files. But it's becoming harder in case of archive chats. When I join a group in community, the group is not showing and if I want to archive the community, its not working. I don't know what happened to the system and if I try to delete the group and the community after leaving, I can't delete it. If its possible then please repair it as soon as possible. Thank Youth"
1,"Ew ,the app was fine b4 but you guys had to go and make things worseüíÄüíÄ talking bout the status ,whys it called UPDATES now .Other than that, now you can't delete multiple statuses at once/ delete selected status. Or view your specific status. ALSO you cant search a specific person's status like bro u want me to scroll n try to find it?? Wat if I had a thousand mutual contacts that post UPDATES n i wanna find their status. The channels look bad. Thank you!!"
3,"Hi, Respected Whatsapp group. I am so glad from Whatsapp and in all social media apps I only use WhatsApp and YouTube. But in the latest update the channels are showing which is a big issue for most of the WhatsApp users. So I requested you to please remove the channel updates and make it like the previous updates. Best regards."
5,"Years ago, I proposed that WhatsApp be operated on several devices and synced with a user, and we're glad it's now possible. I'd want to propose another feature upgrade to segregate groups from conversations. This makes navigation easier. Most people join to hundreds of groups, making it difficult to find a friend's chats. Separating them will benefit us as users. We hope to see this in the next updates."
3,"Hi WhatsApp, I hope you're finding well, I just want to tell you something, that the quality of videos are very bad when I'm sharing to story, whereas the quality of videos are good (like above 720p) I hope you'd like to fix it. Thanks Have a great day!"
4,"""Hello! WhatsApp is evolving day by day, and it's a very good app. I have a suggestion for you that could make it even better. If you implement this idea, it could become the best social networking site. My suggestion is to provide a 'Do Not Disturb' mode in this app. When we're working using the internet, we can keep this app in disabled mode, and when not, in enabled mode. Please consider my suggestion. Thank you.."
5,"Excellent interface . Easy to use. But text colour, font , size ,background colours (presently limited) , chat bubble colour change option may Be provided. This is a serious lapse."
3,"Whatsapp is a good app to connect with all. But I am facing a problem that it doesn't open the video status and video call is not working ,my friends always says oh you are hang, blur, reconnecting. Is there any solution to this ?."
1,"App crashed with flicking screen after using qr code for data transfer. Did not back up via Gmail. Tried restarting, re download and clearing cache. And still not able to get it back working."
2,"Return the previous update where the icons of emojis and stickers are down below Aslo there is a bug whenever I use the keyboard or emojis and I remove the keyboard, a blank space appears between the keyboard input and the last message which looks like it hangs. + whenever I post a status, the media quality of it gets lower."
2,I miss my old WhatsApp please. This last update was horrible. It's the worst. My status slide doesn't have a search option where I could search for a particular status to watch. Not to talk of the annoying placement of the emogi. Please we need our old WhatsApp. Do something about this
5,I really like Whatsapp and here in Brazil it's used for business communication and that is also what I use it for . There is just one thing that really bugs me and might make me give up on WhatsApp and use telegram isntead and that is that on WhatsApp I cannot schedule messages for the next day like I can on telegram. This is a very useful feature that a person can use to schedule messages for the next morning at the time the other business will be opening .I would love it if y'all could add!üôÇ
1,"The absence of an option to disable Channels feature is frustrating. It feels like WhatsApp is shifting from being a private chat app to mimicking social media giants like Facebook and Instagram. This transformation could drive users to migrate to the Signal app, as it appears that WhatsApp is losing sight of its core purpose. Developers, please take note of these concerns and consider the impact on your user base."
4,"I love WhatsApp messenger, I do like the fact that they keep updating it. However, I really dislike some of the latest updates,to be specific the channels, I think they should be optional, I tried to hide them but I couldn't. I think they shouldnt be together with the status update. I hope they change that feature!"
2,"Hello developer, please kindly readjust this update, it's totally off...these recent features are unnecessary as we already have them on IG. It depletes the simplicity of the app. One can't have a glimpse of a recent, no search button amongst other issues. Please help readjust this soon enough"
3,"There is no need to add the edit feature to massage, it removed the value of trust on a whatsapp massage and it's truthfulness and firm factor for any kind of conversation. It's better to not include this feature in future updates. Or at least add an option to view original massage."
3,"don't know if it's yours or my Android's version issue, but some chats suddenly went silent a while ago and I wasn't notified about them so I had to go one by one and turn on the notification. it's pretty unsettling"
5,"Whatsapp is amazing , I could my friends and chat send my location and also share my daily content to everyone using status but I insist whatsapp to add feature where you open your whatsapp by face recognition, thumb recognition or an pin. I like it because any other apps show adds a lot but for whatsapp didn't find an add since 5 years. And also whatsapp should make an upgrade in which there should be an SOS button which when pressed should send an message and also live location via SMS."
4,After the software update to Android 11 can't use the whatsapp properly. Can't send any media or other documents and can't download any files. Pls take this as serious and clear this bug immediately.
5,"My suggestion regarding the need for users to have the ability to create custom folders for organizing their content, such as college friends, family members, and relatives, is indeed a noteworthy idea. Implementing such a feature could enhance user experience and organization significantly. Thank you"
1,"Terrible updates. Disappearing messages in 24 hours not only deleted valuable data but also erased all the relevant information of transactions. Something which is admissable as an evidence in the courts. On reinstalling, previous data cannot be recovered as the email id which is registered has been deactivated."
1,WhatsApp was a good app till the update when channel feature was added....remove it as it doesn't make sense in this app as almost everyone is using it as a messaging app not as a social media like insta youtube ...either remove this feature or provide an option to block it .....
4,"I am giving 4 stars because of some slight glitches both on WhatsApp and WhatsApp web. On WhatsApp, whenever I reply to a video status, the video keeps playing even after I've left the status bar. It only stops when the message is sent. Then, on WhatsApp web, I can't view up to 10 statuses at once. Once I view up to 3,4,5, or more status, the entire app would just go blank, and I have to refresh the site. Please fix the glitches"
1,"I have been using whatsapp for a long time. But recently no feature is being given to me on WhatsApp. Although Whatsapp chat lock features are given to everyone excepted me. Also, even though the WhatsApp channel features are given, But there I can not enter. I have requested WhatsApp community many times to resolve all these issues but no help from there."
1,"automatically scrolls ALL the way uo as soon as I want to read a little bit of my previous conversation of the same day. Not sure why it scrolls all the way up, like to a very old date. Tried from other devices & it still happens so it's intended behavior, but it's not ideal at all and it's counterproductive."
2,"Hi,I m happy using WhatsApp but this new update of channels on status side is very bad idea either change its place or prefer to remove it as it has no use.peole can go to other social media apps for viewing any channel no need to show on WhatsApp as this app contains personal contacts.with this new update of channels I m enable to see the muted status updates.do something for it as soon as possible thanks."
2,the newest sticker/emoji keyboard update is really unfortunate. the interface is confusing and uncomfortable. I prefer the earlier version (even though we couldn't personalize the sticker folders)
4,"WhatsApp has become strange for me I know that it may create this strange feeling towards it because of small issues such as online schools; But these new updates have made something different from what it was..?! Isn't it more like Telegram? I agree that extra features are important, but changing the design of some emojis and...? Sometimes I get upset about unnecessary changes.Anyway, try to keep your special features unlike some apps.I would like to be surprised with a new update, so good luck"
5,"Great app. The new locked chat feature is a great what would make it even better is if there can be multiple ways to hide the ""locked chats folder"" because it's just right there but if it can be really hidden behind the curtain then know one would be suspicious if they should enter your recent tab.üëåüèæ"
1,"The channels is really unnecessary. If you still want that feature, please place it under the status because I don't even subscribe to any channel but it always appears on top of my contacts' statuses. Not to mention that there is no channel that meet my interest."
3,"Since the last update, I notice my phone gradually gets hot when I'm on Video call! I do not know if this is peculiar to me or other users are experiencing this! Please fix up if there's something to it. Thanks. Overall , I like the App"
2,"Dear WhatsApp, I hate the new layout for the emojis and gifs! It has become difficult to maneuver and highly annoying to navigate! PLEASE change it BACK!! I removed one more star because I just realised The ""back "" button has also been replaced with the flag emojis. how ANNOYING!!! üò°üò°üò°"
5,"Whatsapp is an extroadinary app that I use every day. This is certainly the best app for messaging friends and family. With frequent updates this app is really advanced and enjoyable, being able to chat to over 40 people at once! Overall, whatsapp is fantastic app that bearly has any issues and you should certainly download it!"
2,Update regarding status icon that features channels can't be turned off and it's really annoying for me.Also the viewed status need to be sorted in list in order to view them its not like the previous update which showed the viewed status directly.
3,"Give personal space to edit our messages before sending to anyone like in Microsoft Teams app, to avoid mistakes in messages. Give the video & pic rotation (horizontal) option for while putting the status."
3,I love this app been using it for years the reason for the 3 star is you don't have an option (like Facebook) to choose to let someone video call you. On Facebook you can block a person's video calls and just accept voice and messages which is wonderful
1,"Why on earth would you change the emoji layout? Unnecessary changes that make the app feel slower. This app was great in the past; simple, fast, and straight to the point: messaging/calling, period."
1,"Please stop adding junk features ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, it's making the app start to suck, in favor of Signal and the rest Stick to one thing and do that thing well! Btw, just so you know, nowadays WhatsApp keeps crashing abnormally, and I'm sure it's to do with the new unnecessary features you're constantly introducing"
1,Worst ever. Contacted through mail but no response. It's been 2days since WhatsApp is not receiving OTP verification. For my permanent number. Tried with other number and other number OTP verification done with in a second but for my permanent number not received OTP. Tried airplane mode network settings restart reboot but not worked
2,"What I can see to this update is ineffectiveness! What can you say about an experince when you need to reply an important message and you cannot access your account because you have activated 2 factor security feature of fingerprint. And you are reading ""App locked"" Fingerprint is canceled"" and you cannot access your account by aby other means at the moment. This is annoying"
4,The most recent update messes with video status updates. It reduces the visible length of the video even when it is within the 30 second limit.
1,I saw this new 'channel' updates. I don't like this whenever i want to see updates about status i have to see channels. Doesn't make any sense. There should have been some option to hide this channel suggestions.
4,"The latest version is too bad and in status bar there is no search bar ,they have introduced the something channel that is the out of people they are getting it .but anyway the latest version is not good .."
1,"Installation is very poor, the app requires a code. I selected send code by txt several times and it never came I've also tried the phone me option but the automated response is inaudible, each try to get the code has a longer wait time. I've just been told to try again in 5 hours so I give up! No help available either"
4,"i love whatsapp, but i think who ever is updating it is running put of ideas at this point. i cannot get used to the new status update layout or whatever its called.. honestly, i dont think all the celebrities and news channels are neccessary at all. and you cant search for someone's status anymore. i dont like this new update. please revert."
1,"Have you considered making it easier for users by relocating all the buttons to the bottom or providing a bit more space between them? For instance,the ""edit"" button being positioned in the corner often leads me to accidentally tap on the ""copy"" button instead. #Feedback"
1,"So i damaged the screen of my phone, I tried to launch whatsapp on a new phone and I couldn't because verification codes were being sent to a damaged phone. What is the role of the 2 way authentication. Something should be done to this. If I lost my phone that means I can't launch a new phone without recourse to my old phone. Pathetic!"
1,"The updates are unnecessary, it doesn't change much of the app but the update has much MB, like why?? And it's also getting lag after I update it, and even sometimes buggin'. Next time for update, please just fix it and add some cool feature that really useful for the app. I always tryin' being positive to WhatsApp, but I guess now I'm gettin' tired of itüôÑ"
3,I want to change my profile photo but it is not showing all the photos of gallery. Camera photos are not showing at all. I'm searching solution for this from many days still couldn't solve. Please resolve this problem. Almost from 20days I'm struggling with this.
1,"(1st) I couldn't see which groups I joined already after I deleted the group chat history. (2nd) It's too slow to load contacts when I'm going to forward a message. (3rd) YouTube HD videos also working well, but the status on the WhatsApp... loading ü§Æü§Æüí¶"
3,"I couldn't be able to send any video, Experience of using WhatsApp getting worst day by day. Whenever I try to send any video it takes too much time or else it displays ""Choose a different video or try again."" why..? Please fix this issue as soon as possible."
2,"The app provided ways to link 4 devices. But, I can not see button to show what are the devices linked and command to unlink devices. We want transparency. Request password and implement 2 ways security log in before accessing the details on our account."
5,"Certainly, here's a message you can use to contact the WhatsApp support team regarding your lost messages and chats: ""Hello WhatsApp Support Team, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek assistance regarding lost messages and chats on my WhatsApp account. Recently, my WhatsApp got stuck on the 'Initializing' screen, and as a result, a significant portion of my chats and messages seem to have disappeared."
5,"No any problems with whatsApp. I am fully satisfied with the services rendered by whatsapp. Be it video calling or voice calling. Perfect, secure & safe functions. Images,too ,are being sent with üíØ % perfection, hassle free. üëå"
3,"If you could just stop degrading the quality of the videos I upload on my status, I'd be happy. Anyway WhatsApp is a good app. Now you got this channels thing which is really great and I love it. But I was only able to access them for about 48hrs and now when I try to, it just loads and stop loading after 2mins without getting me in. If I gotta pay to access channels, just say so."
4,Nice .. all features but I want an quality of any video and reels while uploading it on status.. yes you gave us an option of upload quality .. but it is not working well .. on status . If that's possible to upload the same quality of videos and photos on WhatsApp status then please over-all good experience.
2,WhatsApp is no longer a simple messenger....... the developers are making it a social media like the new update that added channels feature to it. I guess it was the only app in my device that had minimal addiction but now it has become another source of exhausting mental peace. The developers must rather try to make it more simple. Please remove atleast this new channels feature for now.
3,Change the keyboard back to its old layout. The layout doesn't make sense for usability and the stickers are harder to use now due to the scrolling element. Very frustrating. It is also buggy where the emojis get misplaced as well on the keyboard.
3,The app is operational but there is a glitch. Whenever I try to change the filter of my photos. The filter section just gets stuck in the middle and doesn't allow me to change filter.
2,It is very difficult to undo a mistake. And to delete a number. I can't find chats I have mistakenly archived. Also I mistakenly added contacts to groups! To easy to make a mistake. Too hard to rectify it.
1,"Hello, Recently it has been repeatedly happened that the date of what's app has changed to an incorrect date. Multiple times I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app from play store, and for a while the issue has resolved. But again and again it happened. Please troubleshoot this problem."
2,When I try to take picture in whatsapp im frustratingüò£‚òπÔ∏è bcoz the feature is not comfortable white I take picture suddenly down new featured photos are opening every time so change and in status y there is no search option tym waste boz we should scroll down it's very bad so pls add search option for already viewed status... Please change dear thnkz whtsapp good app i ‚ù§Love it.
2,"I need more privacy, can you guys remove the notification when I change my number ( notification changed from XXXXXXXXX to YYYYYYYYY). Also, the report, y'all should add something where I can write a description in it, not just share the last 5 messages, because I need to explain a few things. And please change the blocking from just number blocking to IP blocking, or at least add an option where I can block IP."
5,A very good app for communicating with friends & family. The privacy features are excellent. But sometimes media loading takes a long time and becomes very frustating retrying to load media several times.
3,"3 stars for a while, perfect apps for messaging ,but the story feature for android still blurry whatever the resolution we pick before we upload it.. please change it into a better one, because it really help others to promote via story with a HD quality .. hope you hear these advice"
4,"Great App! Easy to Use! Better Video/Voice Call Experience! But, We Can't Pause/Resume The Backuping Media. It Spoils My Video Call Experience During My Classes. Please Correct the Error As Soon As Possible."
1,"Please what is this new update with whatsapp?!!! It's disgusting to be frank. You guys changed everything completely. WhatsApp interface was very user friendly to begin with, but your latest updates are just repulsive. I've been so confused with viewing statuses. Why do I have to swipe to view statuses, instead of scrolling to make it easier? What is even the use of channels? Even stickers and emojis, you changed the way we view them. It's tiring. Please revert to the WhatsApp we love. Thanks"
4,It's cool but there is a problem always with the camera and flash. It never clicks picture with the flash. It's either a complete white picture or complete dark. Plus the size for sending flies can be increased.
1,"The pic which I post in status is terrible and the new features are wrost,the serch option in status is no more,those channels are annoying,muted status is not in the screen,new updates make the app wrost... totally disappointed"
4,"The latest updates are cool. But please, add ""translate"" button. In telegram, there's translate the message when holding and choosing the message that is sent in other languages. Thanks in advance."
1,"Try creating a less addictive app. Whatsapp is getting way more like Instagram and YouTube nowadays.... instead of using it for our necessity purpose...they are trying to get us spend much time in the app with the latest ""Find your channel"" upgradation. If this is the case we might want to resort on to telegram. No doubt everyone will get engaged with Whatsapp now on. Try designing an social media app that doesn't create addiction"
4,"Overall it's a good choice but I think meta should do something about the order of the media that we forward to others. They should be sent in the order they are actually selected and sent by by the person. This would be a big help for sharing stff like pictures, videos etc."
4,"Hello please add an option where we can highlight a message in group chats. So that if there is any important message, we can highlight it for everyone to see and isn't ignored or lost among other messages. Great app."
1,"Awful, lost years of chat history, developers no help. After a factory reset on my phone the back up from my google drive wouldn't restore, I did as developers suggested but it didn't work. Developers then wouldn't respond, after sending new emails saying what I had done it seems like it was just the same blanket response asking me to do what I'd already done as if they hadn't even read the email, they then again didn't respond to my replies. If I could give zero stars I would."
4,"Great app as always, but can we please move archived chats to the bottom. I don't want to see I have a notification from a chat in the archive. I understand you can move it to the bottom by disabling ""keep chats archived,"" but the chat then moves out of the archive when a message is received."
1,Temporarily banned without a clear clarification on what exactly was the exact issue and not a way to rectify or contact customer support to resolve unknown problem.. And yes.. someone said the gif turns messy after update.
4,"So the recent update for the WhatsApp is nice introducing news chanel and all. My suggestion is just that I will like you to have a separate section for the status and news channel cause viewing status horizontally is kind of tedious to me so if you can make it vertically as well as the news channel, it will be appreciated."
4,There is a problem with whatsapp . I want to show my last seen only to three to four people but my last seen is open for everybody mean who's last seen is on can automatically see my last seen and online and this the new problem with WhatsApp.. have a look at this updtae.. it's privacy concern ... Solve the issues as soon as possible thanks
3,Can you guys pls give us more time on what's app STATUS stories . It's really hard to upload videos cos we get only 30 SECONDS . And voice notes for status's also is only 30 SECONDS . Pls do try to make it longer at least more than a minute or 2 so we don't have to upload it on so many parts üòí
4,Since purchased by Meta this app has been slowly becoming a social media app. The latest update is forcing social media on the status screen. There are no options to hide this feature either. Otherwise I love this app it's very universal.
5,"A very convenient and efficient communication app. However, I am getting temporary bans more frequently recently even though I am a bona fide user and I do not use this app to scrap (don't know what scraping is. And my WhatsApp was downloaded from Play Store. Hence, I am requesting for a review. Would greatly appreciate your prompt review and restoration. Thank you!"
1,"I'm even regretting why I upgraded my whatsapp. I have lost all of my charts. I have backed up all my chatts but the new whatsapp is unable to retrieve the messages. It's been 2 days now and I'm still getting ""waiting for this massage, this may take a while "" I need to retrieve those messages and now I can't. How do I hold back to my old whatsapp?????"
2,"I've always enjoyed using WhatsApp. The latest update with the emoji and keyboard layout is horrible. Hence my 2 stars so you fix it. Very annoying to use and makes things feel awkward and unpleasant. My keyboard app now has a better emoji keyboard than whatsapp. Other than that, whatsapp is nice to use. Calls stable most of the time, video quality good. The in app camera is bad for whatever reason. so take the photo with your camera app and then send it on WhatsApp."
2,The update tab which was previously status is not useful. It makes the user experience more complicated and status is not easily accessed esp. muted status. The change was abrupt and unnecessary.
3,"For last 2 days, got some issues. Messages not being sent nor received. A grey tick appears when message sent and when someone sends a message...not received. Tried almost every option ... Reinstalled, phone restarted a number of times, cleared cache....no use. Plz guide what to do.... ?"
4,"It's a very great up,if only you could provide an option to freeze it for certain periods of time and only unfreeze it after the time elapses."
1,"The new feature of channels has totally ruined my experience of WhatsApp. WhatsApp was supposed to be contacts only. It was my personal space with the people who have my no. I don't want to follow a celebrity. If I wanted that I could have followed them on insta, YouTube or Twitter."
1,There's a bug in the WhatsApp... numbers are automatically getting blocked. I haven't done anything wrong or posted anything wrong but my number got blocked and WhatsApp isn't giving any reason. Many of my known are facing this problem. Look into the matter and unblock my account.
1,"So this text symbol ""üñæ"" received from a new contact on whatsapp, displays the as a rectangle with crosses on a Motorola but when forwarded to this phone shows up as bold text "" nh"" Is my Whatsapp acting up again? I know it's supposed to be unsupported emoji, but then why would it transmutate to a text on another phone? WhatsApp unblocks a contact I've blocked . Please fix!"
5,This app is great‚ù§Ô∏è and connecting me with my family and friends just a problem I am facing is when you linked an account on multiple device its not allowing me to add contacts on secondary device the contact must be add on primary device otherwise the contact will not be shown in the secondary device kindly resolve this issue and allow secondary device to add contact alsoüòá
5,"I don't really have a problem with this app it's really a great one , and what's making even better those update, but I really want a new update, it's close to the one view consept (I'm talking exactly about that we can't record or scrinshot of those videos ow pics ) but for the video calls to stop recording or taking shots"
4,"It stop its fuctioning suddenly and cannot archive the chats.I have unistall and reinstall the application to make it work.its been the second time its happening.last month this happened and again now. I have alot of crucial documents and college groups,and everytime this happens i lost all of this. Its been a great app until this happens."
3,Ok but what the hell is this update where channel are showing below status area . It is so annoying it is a messaging app don't turn it into tv. This is useless and very very annoying just tell me a procedure in order to unupdate this seriously üòí!!!!
5,@teamWhatsapp Please add an important button in message. So that when I send messages selecting it as important it will notify everyone (including those who have muted that group). Just like when we tag someone in group he is notified even when he has muted the group. Thank you
4,"Good app.... the only bug it has right now and for a few months is that the date skips (reward or forward) and the chat log gets misplaced and sometimes you cannot find the recent chats.. It sometimes gets fixed if you clear the cash and/or update the app... but now that i am writing this review, none of the ebove worked and my sent chats are dated tomorrow.... dont know what else to do to solve it.."
1,"Has NOTHING new copared to Telegram, been at both from about 7 years now, and Whatsapp just got worse, trying to Imitate some of Telegram features. First, In 2023 you can not save your files in the cloud yet! Second It still shows who edited and who deleted some massage like it is just better not to. Becomes total potato if outdated (which happens a lot!) Useless Proxy update_good but unusable at last Does not support oneway channels Needs seperate apps just for stickerpacks To be continued..."
1,"Useless programming, stop forcing your customers to your ideal standards of how their WhatsApp should be. If I had the choice to opt out it would be beneficial for both parties. It's my phone and I do not agree to this, please remove this new feature from Whatsapp completely."
5,"It's an amazing app to use if you want to message multiple people or just a person. You can call and video call people as well as just texting. You can send emojis and GIFs, photos and videos.. It is truly an amazing app and I recommend to people.."
5,"WhatsApp is my top choice for staying connected. It's user-friendly, secure with end-to-end encryption, and offers high-quality calls and media sharing. Love the new disappearing messages feature. A must-have app!"
3,"3 stars because I dont like the new update with the channels, there is no point in adding them, now statuses are grouped into view updates, its useless. Change it back. Regards"
4,I don't feel like I upload high quality pictures. When I upload pictures on status or in chat box it looks standard quality. WhatsApp should fix this problem as soon as possible.
2,"I'm not happy with the Most recent update. It is slow in response, i can't share file without it taking about 3 mins to load my contacts, i can't easily swipe through status even after I've viewed them, etc Generally, it is slow, please work on the app again"
2,This app has had the same mediocre UI basically since it was created. Please modernize the interface and get rid of the whack green bar at the top. The Windows desktop app is beautiful and the Apple app is far superior in appearance as well. Just make it look like the Windows version.
2,After this latest update till 21 July 2023 the app has started lagging in interface. Also while opening emoji button there is a massive gap between the emojis and the text appearing on above screen. The overall application is getting stuck üòï. Please fix this bug or issue ASAP.
1,I own a samsung galaxy s10 plus phone. Seems the new feature for video messages doesnt work or is not available for my phone. I have the latest version on the store. This sucks!
1,"WhatsApp used to work before for me, but now it doesn't. So I uninstalled it and I am glad I did. The phone runs much better now and I have more space. WhatsApp was the worst piece of junk and i needed to get rid of it to make my phone work faster."
1,"Got a new phone, it's actually impossible to successfully transfer chat messages over. Tried both Google Drive and whatsapp transfer feature and both absolutely useless at such a simple thing. Just another app/software ruined after a Google takeover"
1,"Someone has hacked my WhatsApp account since last four days. My friend is sending inappropriate messages with his friends. WhatsApp team has not yet responded to my email. There is end to end encryption, no one can hack it, what is WhatsApp, is there any such thing as security. This means that no one's data is safe on WhatsApp."
3,I can't save contacts upon receiving a new message in WhatsApp. Also in my phone's contact list within each saved number I can see the list of messengers they're using but WhatsApp is not shown for any contact. Updated and reinstalled but the issue is not resolved.
1,New update is making writing and using emojis an absolute nightmare. I loved the fact that the pages didn't scroll endlessly. It also needs a full second to switch keyboards which slows down typing. Absolutely hate it.
3,"Ôøº ##- WhatsApp Support -## Hi, Unfortunately, there isn't enough information for us to help solve this issue. Please include these details: Your phone number in full international format.Information about your phone (e.g. operating system, model, etc.).Explanation of what you're doing and why.Error messages and what they say.Step-by-step process we can follow to reproduce the issue.Screenshots or a video of the issue. You can use another device to take a photo of the screen or record the vi"
1,The app used to work. I'm not able to see the preview thumbnails of videos before selecting them. Support is just generic and off-topic. It might be terrible trained personnel or some non working AI algorithm.
3,The app is Awsome! But when I try to send the reactions it doesn't load up it gets worse and even everyone was saying that there is a problem going on so there needs to be an fix or bug fix (If you're sure that if there is a bug) Update
3,Some features are not working normally. Example chat doesn't scroll up on its own when a message is sent. Waiting for an update with this fix.
3,"can u guys make the time limit for the video uploaded in status longer? like at least 1 min? bcs i have to talk real quick for 30 secs like ksnxaojx then it ends. plus, i have to cut the video every 30 secs which is quite tiring. also, pls don't compress the size of the vid/pic as it'll ruined the quality of it. fix this prob. ik its hard but its for ur users:) even after i change it to ‚Äòbest quality', no changes. please, please fix this (EDITED)"
1,Everything is OK but sharing picture or video in status reduce the quality of the content it make to blurry. You think it's fixed by setting > storage and data > best quality. But it's not efficient. So kindly fix as soon as possible
1,"The new sticker tray is very bad and ruins the typing experience substantially. It almost feels like using viber messenger, and this is the reason why we all stopped using it and switched to WhatsApp. Kindly give an option to revert back to previous setting."
4,I'm Very disappointed still this time as the Chat Lock feature only favors Fingerprint and Facelock. It could be better if Passwords or PIN codes were included as well and if the feature should also work on the linked devices as well. I thought this could have been put into consideration in the recent updates but üò¥üò¥üò¥
4,"Good, apart from when I'm trying to listen to Voice notes, my screen goes black, and sometimes it would pause the voice note, and when I would try to play it again, it would glitch."
5,"I love whaatsapp for so many educative adds such as concerning ""Health""also in the area of charts and sending of messages across to loved ones and getting replies almost immideately is quite interesting too,so many other features inclussiive,but the areas that borders one most are the "" cleaning apprratus""they disturbs a lot for their repiititions/non stopping, else,as time goes on more issues 'll be pointed ,i equally encourage to cntinue doing your very best as nothing is ""perfect""Tha"
5,Thanks for providing us with great update for the greatest chat app of all time! Please I have a suggestion. Transferring my dad's contacts from his old iPhone 6 to an android phone and none of the apps for data sharing Apple to android seem to be work. I suggest there is update that allows you to install a list of contacts at once via WhatsApp. Thank you!
5,"This is a great app. I love this. In the past, I sent info to anyone of my contacts, so that I can later open and see. With this App, I will not bother others. Further, I definitely know, where the information/message was sent. Thank you."
1,"Why not allow external SD card as default storage option!? I have to move files manually to external card but it's cumbersome, and remove all references in the chats itself, so it become useless. I can even pay something if it allow default external SD card storage option. I know it's doable by jailbreak, etc but why not include this option in app itself!? It'll make life so much easier, without need of deletion or moving."
5,"Excellent üëç service, twinkle communication mean. Huge paper saving. Pl do improve is editor a bit with basic features. Otherwise the application is excellent. Bravo on the part of development team."
1,"I hate the latest update. You make the status shorter and its anoying when you have a long vid to send. Honestly this year update is getting worst. I need you to fix all the bugs that most of us mention. I need the old whatsapp software. Its more fun, i couldnt even sent longer vid on status anymore its pretty anoying. FIX THE DAMN SOFTWARE. You basicly ruin the mood here. Fix it with the next update or your rating will be the worst nightmare for your company!"
1,"The video status on my whatsapp is not taking more than 30 seconds. I have tried all the settings, even uninstalled whatsapp and downloaded it again, but still not working. The video is not taking more than 30 seconds."
1,"Latest update is worst version of whatsapp till date. Whatsapp is for personal use then why these public personality channel are there. If we want to see them, there are many other options like instagram, youtube but whatsapp is not place for that. Latest update just ruins my whatsapp experience. No option is there to hide them as many of us don't want see them on our personal basis."
1,The new version for pc is not comfortable. Can't drag files to attach. Not comfortable at all. Older version don‚Äôt have this problem. Why the newer version don‚Äôt have the same feature as before?
2,I'm probably having problems signing in. Like I don't have a simcard in my phone. It's in another phone but it wants to automatically detect the SMS which is impossible. Now I've failed to actually login. Please work on this immediately coz I'm facing problems. I want to use it now!! What should I do. The last versions were OK but this one isn't....
4,"Everything is fine, awesome, used it for years. Great calls, love it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I can't seem to find the new feature of sending video messages. I liked that feature. Did you remove it?"
3,The sticker tray has been buggy since the redesign. I can only access the front row of sticker packs. It won't let me swipe to my older packs. All this work put into my custom stickers just to end up being unable to use them ever again... Please fix this bug asap
1,The new version of WhatsApp is not a very good because the options for call status etc are now present below the real problem is that the screen area smaller than before and if we have to find our relatives contacts we scroll like anything and even it is taking more and not looking good you are understanding the point right? Your regular user
1,"I did what's app video call to my friends, i am able to hear their voice, they are unable to hear my voice. Very worst app. They are so many bugs is there."
4,"The best and most convenient texting app there is! It's fast and reliable. An added bonus is the desktop app to access your messages from your computer, super helpful! Update: I removed a star because the new redesign of the emoji panel is TERRIBLE!"
1,"Also put a button to turn off the channel in the status. Please we don't want to see. If you are adding some new feature, then add a button to remove it also. Everyone liked this feature. This is not necessary. Why should we forcefully see someone's status?"
4,"I love the app. It's safe. I just want to have a feature by which we can disable people so that they can't take screenshots/download our profile picture or status. Just like we share our status to those want, in the same way i want to block some contact so that they can't save/screenshot my profile picture. And also the option so that no one can download/screenshot our status through any other status downloader App. This will be a greate approach of WhatsApp team................................."
3,"Can you please change the emoji part back to how it was before the update?! And why can't I archive community groups?! Please do something nice for the next update...more customizing options like the keyboard ,colours,etc. Also whatsapp is starting to use loads of data and a lot of people around me wants to uninstall whatsapp!"
4,"Reg. recent update for community groups: As soon as we click on a chat, instead of displaying the community info screen; as we do earlier, going to the chat screen will be more convenient and meaningful. The option provided on the right top corner of the chat screen is sufficient for those who are looking for the community info I believe. Also when we change a basic system behaviour unnecessarily, will bring uncertainty and confusion among users n' they tend to switch to new ones. Thanks team."
5,You can now natively transfer full account history when switching to a new device. Go to Settings > Chats > Transfer Chats. ‚Ä¢ Video calls now support landscape mode. ‚Ä¢ You can now silence unknown callers. Go to Settings > Privacy > Calls to get started. These features will roll out over the coming weeks. Thanks for using WhatsApp!
2,The voicenote playback has suddenly stopped playing the next voicenote. It only plays one and then you have to physically press each one to play. Can this be fixed please.
5,WhatsApp is one of the most useful and easy way to reach our loved ones across the globe. I see it as the best option when it comes to wanting to reach others. You guys have given the world an easier way to remain in contact with each other. To share love and relevance. You have done well especially to have added the edit of messages send within 15 minutes. That's great üëç I appreciate you all for job well done.
1,"After getting an update it's been now 1 week since whatsapp calls didn't work well. The call suddenly drops and then if you call someone it displays an error ""connecting"" every time and it's only the app that doesn't work well while all other apps work fine so internet is not the issue."
1,"Whatsapp encryption sucks! I am not able to restore my encrypted-chats despite having entered Encryption password correctly. Contrastingly, it says that ""This account is not associated with the password"". If thats the case, why it is asking me to even enter the password? I have noted my Encryption password accurately, no doubt in that at all."
5,"Good LORD there are some shockingly absurd complaints about the functionality of this app. How absolutely ludicrous you people are. Seriously, work on your basic cognitive skills along with your hand eye coordination. The app has NO issues. Unlike the majority of the human race, unfortunately for us all."
5,"Very good contact application. WhatsApp messenger is very good with recreations as you can design your wallpaper for single or all people and you can make busy sentences for example ""I'm out town"" you can choose one on the list or make your own.üòÄüòÄ"
2,I don't understand this new updates. I can't delete status before 24hours and I don't like it. I don't like the way the search button has been removed. Pls put the search button back to the status page and also the option button so I can delete status within 24 hours if I want
5,"It makes our life more easy. It's a good medium for communication. In fact we can communicate with a group of people at the same time. It's really a good app. Also we can use it for study purposes like notes sharing, group study, online classes , etc."
4,"It has been a tremendous design in terms of sharing, chatting & calling with friends and family. Additionally, this application has updated to a higher level of data protection and handy for illiteracy users as well. It's a simple and unique app designed for multiple purposes."
1,"After the last update, I have been struggling when adding emojis while texting. If I want to add an emojo, the text moves to the top and disappears, then there's like 40%, of empty screen and at the bottom the emojis' panel appears. My gf has the same problem and she uses a s23+"
1,"Yesterday, the display of emoticon, sticker, etc changed and makes me uncomfortable, maybe other users same as I am. I hope your team can restore and fix the display of emoticon and sticker, ist very annoying, disturbing and uncomfortable to choose and use. Thank you."
2,"So... July 2023 WhatsApp's update made uncomfortable the user experience by disabling the possibility of manage the statuses, now we have to go one by one to delete them instead of pick several at time as I was able to do in previous version. No one needed that and you manage to screw it. WhatsApp is getting worse."
2,"The new update is stressful,I can't view my status updates individually as before,I can't also search for people's status. This is more of a downgrade,we don't want whatsapp to be like Instagram,let it remain as WhatsApp,that's why we use it. We need the normal WhatsApp status feature back, and we don't need a channels feature on WhatsApp."
1,If an emergency i cant the whatsapp at the moment.. it may take long time to open the app.. hopeful review my whatsapp very soon. Thank you. Still the same problem this is second time im giving a bad feedback .. I can't send a voice recording other couldn't hear to my voice note
2,"Nice upgrade on the app, but will be more appreciated if channels and status update can be separated and different page.. it sucks this way, if you continue doing it this way, people will get tired viewing status update, it will affect people who run businesses on whatsapp. Kindly do some correction, Pls.. Thanks."
2,"Hello. I updated the app on my phone and there are some issues with it. Once I open the app it suddenly closes and I see this error ""WhatsApp closed bcs this app has a bug"". How may I fix it without the risk of loosing my data (I'm not sure if I have the last backup of my messages)?"
1,"With this you are basically getting a shadow Facebook profile without your consent. All contacts were slurped into FB at opening. They can infer name, sensible information like job, gender, health by keeping a graph of your contacts. Chat statistics, photos, media, documents are stored and indexed into FB infrastructure. They try to register your fingerprint. They CAN READ YOU silently with the linked devices ""feature"". I wish all messengers used a standard protocol not their closed source one."
1,"It is a big disappointment that no more pop up notifications of messages received can be set for Android version 10 and above. New messages can only be made known until I open the app (my phone is not with 24/7 and moreover, it is in silent mode at times)."
1,It's not messaging app it's commercials app recently new channel introduced after someday it will be Facebook and Instagram you can access from WhatsApp. We need another alternative to do messaging with privacy I am deleting WhatsApp as well. 1 year before deleting Facebook and Instagram. Guys please be careful before accessing any new features it has new term and condition but we don't have time to read it and that's the Plus point they are utilising it to make money while processing or data.
5,"WhatsApp messaging to yourself is a great improvement in the app which is appreciable. If possible, introduce the feature of creating groups with yourself. Entrepreneurs will make different groups with themselves to remember different issues, it will be very easy for them. Everyone will like it."
1,Hating the new channels features with the status option. .. I mean why that's so unnecessary....you can add another slot for channels but don't put with statuses together that's so annoying..
3,"Would give 5 Stars if I understood why Whatsapp keeps ALL of my Contacts and their respective phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, etc, in their system. Yes, the messages we send back and forth are encrypted, but the info WhatsApp gets from our phones is not protected. If I didn't need this app to keep in touch with friends abroad... I wouldn't agree to these Terms and Agreements."
1,The technical support lack produre to help consumer to solve the problem. I have been mailing the support team from past two days and haven't received and proper reply. They just keep giving computerised answer. That doesn't like a professional way of handling consumer problem.
1,The new update of WhatsApp is so annoying. WhatsApp was like personal and private thing. Now this channel additions and so many new content like mix... similar like snapchat and so many others apps no more unique private or simple.. it became lengthy in terms of storing medias or stories setups and ui also so oveelook.
4,"Great app for communication. I have only one issue, can you guys please move down the Archive chats down to the bottom of our chats. I have to say they are really not Archived because when we see there's a message we go looking into them straight away, always peeping and we do not forget about the chats. Please make this one changeüôè"
2,"My app keeps saying ""your account has been blocked from using WhatsApp due to spam"". I send a review then the account is back working properly for some time the later the same problem perssists ..... I even tried cahnging numbers but the problem has persisted to my new number too... I really find this annoying.... Please fix this"
1,"The most horrible experience I have ever had and currently having is what's app time & again disabling my number. They claim they have done accidentally,but everyday the same issue!!! Everyday by night you block my account with various excuses. Frds do not use what's app go to telegram it's user friendly and no such harrasment"
1,HORRIBLE TO TRY TO USE ON PC. i use both cell and laptop. adding new contacts from laptop is a nightmare if not impossible. the engineers there seem incompetent to develop a trans-platform app. really !?!?!
1,"What is the use of the `Find channel`in WhatsApp. It is irrelevant, too much advertisement even on chatting apps. Please remove it immediately. One cannot remove it or delete it, it is there even though we don't need it that much. So, PLEASE REMOVE THE NEW FEATURES"
5,"good app but to the side of voice call is not so clear,it scratch scratch I don't know is due to our local network carrier or watsapp net and I suppose the arrangements inside of the up to be names side as it was before,sms side,call side and icone but not you touch sms icone is so you get the name as now,thanks for listening to me my thoughts."
1,"There is bug with the new emoji interface. When the emoji keyboard popup, the message inputing box will go up to the upper third of the screen, leaving a blank space in the middle, and the emoji keyboard at the lower part of the screen, super user-not-friendly"
5,Great app love the design and the new features. The only feature that is missing is a feature that shows if someone is online when you don't tap on the chat to see if he or she is online so please add that feature please
2,"i like the WhatsApp, very helpful. But there's something I don't understand about the privacy feature that not online and the blue tick ‚úÖ. isn't whatApps made for easy communication? i think it's just like normal SMS,if they activate the privacy. so many reasons they activate the privacy. I hope, whatApps can more better. All users can experience the existing features including blue tick and online. thanks. 5 stars to follow"
5,"I always open this application, because this application is enjoy and easy to use especially for communication with others. As long as you have a good internet networking, then your connection is stable neither messages, call, nor video call."
2,"A suggestion to the Developers, Would you please update the Instagram version of deleting messages. It doesn't look nice to see ""This message was deleted."" On the chat. We deleted a message just because we don't want opposite person to read in the first place. What is the use of that message when deleted? I literally have terrific experience using WhatsApp because of this reason. As it comes under FaceBook too, I am requesting you to bring this feature in your next update."
1,This app is a total scum. I've never seen such a useless all in my life. Honestly it's just a source of frustration. I have never used another device to log in but it's requesting for a code sent to a phone that I never even used. Extremely useless. Don't download it
2,"Wattsapp is the most unorganized app. U send 2 photos that are of same topic, it sends separately, the text only goes under one. And then u send another 3 photos which are of another topic, and the watsapp just puts a photo from first between the others. Like cmon, update along with the other apps already"
1,"Cam chat is STILL broken. Can't use cam on landscape, can only view other person on portrait mode. Reinstalling no longer fixes it temporarily. As I'm deaf it's essential I see my calls in landscape mode full screen so I can see signing. This is unacceptable and an extremely disablist issue. Stop naffing about with superficial cosmetic nonsense and MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE AGAIN."
3,"It has nothing to say in comparison with telegram. Limited file size is a shame. Worst of all is, lit keeps all files on the phone and cause memory full problem. Update: By copying telegram features, it's getting better and better every update."
4,It would be great to have a screen recording option because some moments are magical and I want to capture all of them because someday all those moments will become memories and I want to look back at it and relive those moments.
1,After Playing status and closing also... status is still running in background ...after closing the app in background it is stopping...when I close the status then video also has to stop but it is not happening.Please find the bug and fix it..iam giving it as 1 star to prioritise this issue after successful fix I will change my rating..hope u will fix this bug...
1,My whatsapp keeps getting banned and restored yet I have not violated any community guildlines. This has happened multiple times for the past two days and they have not shown any interest in resolving the issue. This is causing alot of inconviniences and is affecting my experience when the app.
4,If you have given an option to lock a chat with fingerprint then it shouldn't allow to open the chat with the same PIN of the phone it should have an option to choose a new pin otherwise if someone knows the phone pin they can easily open the chat and read everything even if the person is not available to scan there own fingerprint and as it's mentioned hidden chat then it should be hidden completely within the app itself and should have an option to hide it in a separate folder
1,I am not receiving call notifications on my phone when locked...sometimes it ring and mostly it doesn't but ...while all other notifications are normal even message notifications are fine but the phone doesn't ring on call when screen is locked...I have checked already the notification settings
1,"Dear developers, why did you ruin a perfectly good app? After the latest update the app is starting to crash and it is very annoying. There's a lot of bugs here and there. Please fix this ASAP. And bring back the old version of status display."
4,"When reacting to a message I cannot search for an emoji anymore, it starts typing a new message instead. Also, stickers are now all in one giant list instead of separated on starred and used previously. So the update removed some functions but I have not found any new or improved ones..."
4,Great update about screensharing option. But if the feature would be like when someone is sharing their screen their video should also be visible. So it will be nice to know their expression as well! Please try this improvise this feature so it will be helpful. THANKS!
3,"For the recent updates in the app, which are NOT good. Like Channels thing, bro it's a personal and family social app. Why do you need to introduce Instagram like celebrity updates? And the emoji pallette was horizontally scrollable and now its vertical. That earlier made you different from Google's emoji vertical scrollable pane. In pursuits of updates you are losing originality and individuality. Please do it like before. Channels is not needed. Keep the app simple. Request u."
2,"Whatsapp updates or whatever it is just doesn't seem convenient. Pls just add extra button elsewhere for the ""updates"", don't have to hide the status. I still want to access muted status easily. The other day the emoji gif sticker got mixed up and it was a mess."
1,"Whatsapp is supposed to be an ad-free app yet, the new updates does not give an option to remove the channel ads and suggestions from the updates tab. PLEASE REMOVE THIS SECTION!! It covers all the status updates! Worst update ever!!"
4,"It is realy a nice app, i am supposed to rate five stars, but the thing is that my WhatsApp suddenly stopped working . Although the upgrading time hasn't reached yet and now i have to delete it and download another one and it is making me so angry üò° i fell so surfisticated. But apart from that it is a nice one. Good dose to the creators of this wonderful app"
5,"I mostly like its privacy system, no contact no chat. And especially as there is no ads, it is such a beautiful messaging tool, and its voice notes are highly appreciated, thumbs up to the creators of voice and videos notes."
4,"üëåThe app is cool, never had any terrible experience using it. But I think there should be a medium for reporting scams, and WhatsApp should be very active in blocking such accounts. People are really swindling people on WhatsApp big time. EDIT: WhatsApp users should be able to upload audio clips in their status."
2,"We all prefer the old whatsApp emoji, sticker layout as because the new one is not working well and have some minor glitches. Also everything refreshes whenever we open whatsApp keyboard so it takes some seconds to show us emoji, sticker option. Please give us the option to set it back to old section layout."
1,"Great app, BUT... With the latest update, ""Channels"" were added. I DON'T WANT THEM IN MY STATUS FEED! Allow me to opt out or give the option to remove ""Channels"" Then I will change my review."
1,It was good before but now its full of bugs It gives sound that whatsapp gives when a file is sent when the file is not sent also it decreases the quality of status whenever I upload high quality file on status and this issue is only seen by android users WhatsApp is not doing anything about it iPhone users are not facing any issue like this WhatsApp must fix this issue of status and file sending sound and multiple files that can't be sent at the same time
1,There is a big issue with the new Update.. When we select any picture to send the other hand...if we try to crop the picture..after cropping the screen goes black and cannot send the picture to the receipent. Big issue... Fix it as soon as possible
1,"'Face ID' authentication works for chat lock, but in devices without a fingerprint sensor, but with 'Face ID' setup 'Screen Lock' option isn't provided at all ? Does it not make sense to replace *'Fingerprint Lock'* with *'Screen Lock'* option in settings ... 'Settings -> Privacy -> Screen Lock' ... instead of ... 'Settings -> Privacy -> Fingerprint Lock' ?"
1,"After i updated whatsapp, i got a notification that state my account got banned. I had to change my phone number but the previous contact and document got lost. I hope the management can identify the problem and help me get back my account. Also i would like to complain how I can't switching emoji and text so fast. The update seem unnecessary as it would be such a hassle to change between text and emoji."
1,"I've always valued WhatsApp for its minimalistic approach, but the recent update adding CHANNELS to the status section feels excessive! I don't want to see influencers and updates there; I use WhatsApp to connect with my network and loved ones. Such influx of content on WhatsApp is threatining its minimalistic appeal and flooding our inboxes. You have already ruinined instagram for us, don't do the same with what's app!"
2,"There is huge bug in WhatsApp, While taking photos from whats app application, Photos is not captured and screen getting stuck after that getting error as File format not supported. I thought this error only from me but now a days everyone facing the same issue on what's app application. I don't know what's app already rectified this issues or not, but it is very irritating thing in WhatsApp"
3,This app literally broke my phone screen. All of a sudden you can't use Bluetooth to make calls so I had to hold it and I down my phone. If I could use Bluetooth I would have had my hands free. Nice job meta geniuses.
4,"While I am connected to WhatsApp application on my Windows Laptop, i can connect to call on it and simultaneously I can also connect to another call using the same account with my mobile WhatsApp application. I don't know if it's a bug or something else. Kindly review this feature."
1,"This new channels update is annoying and very very very unnecessary, why is this becoming like Instagram, who wants to follow channels, whatsapp should be personal not for things like this.... I'd very much like if you guys could consider removing it . what's next we will soon be able to go live smh"
2,"This UPDATE is a MESS!! Very backwards and difficult to utilize properly! Delay in message receipt. Lay out is unnecessary, it's not social media app!! It's a text & call app!! I have no desire to follow random people I never heard of and do NOT want to speak to!!"
5,Been using this app for quite some time now and I haven't had any issues with it with the exception of phone calls. The reception isn't always that great and there are times when you have drop calls. Guess this is something they'll need to work on.
2,Major issue with video sharing... App will not share any clips. Can't send this video repeatedly appears and doesn't allow videos to be sent. Fix please.
3,"After updating my WhatsApp and used it for a few days it actually stopped working . it's telling me ""something went wrong with my chat history "" and it also gets slow sometimes especially when I have to update my whatsapp status. Please l want this to be dealt with because whatsapp is a good app and also a very reliable app . You don't also have to worry because whatsapp is highly secured and backed up that's why I like this app and I hope you retify this Issue."
3,"It is okay but there is one thing.. When you upload a 30 sec video or reel as a status, the quality of the video decreases and that is awful! not good at all. So, please solve this issue. Thanks."
1,The most worest updates ever recently.. I can't see all my status messeges same time as before and I'm forced to see others status by mistake.. Also sharing status to facebook icon is in a bad place and we may share to facebook by mistake.. get whatsapp status the same old way before these recent awful updates.
2,"i like to put something in my status everyday, but recently i hate it..when i put the videos, it said ""can't send the video, please use different video"" like eh.. that's one problem. the second problem is i can't select the video or photo that i upload to delete it..PLEASE GIVE US BACK THE BUTTON TO SELECT THE STATUS AND DELETE ONE BY ONE! the error video, i still can't delete it tho.. i just want the delete button back"
1,Sep13 worse update ever on WhatsApp up... status bar ... now it's looking like Instagram or Facebook üò©ü§¨... It's so annoying or irritating... Or there are no options to remove or mute the... suggession of celebrity or update features Pls ..fix it ...or remove the features.. Old version was the best..
2,"Even after adjusting all the settings, uploading photos or videos on WhatsApp status, it looks broken and blurry. Also, while uploading Full HD video, an error occurs which can't set Full HD video status."
4,"WhatsApp is great obviously! But specifically right now the problem is, I need to prioritise certain people while do not disturb is on. And I cannot access that feature unless I receive a message notification where I then can individually select that chat settings."
1,I don't find any changes on my whatsapp. It's still some . Without any updates or features. I'm don't find any update section in exchange for status. So l can't join any whatsapp channels. So fix it right now please. Thanks in advance
1,"Shortly, after setting up the app it was suspended. They sent a msg the next day saying 'We suspended your account in error, sorry'. Fine. I sent one msg to a friend in England consisting of two words: ""test message"". Now, several weeks later, when I go to actually use the app, it is again suspended for 'violating usage policy'. I am confused... which word violated the policy; ""test"" or ""message""?! No info on what I allegedly did or option to appeal; only to register another number. Smh."
1,"Whatsapp, is bad on all levels. From speed, to UI, unresponsive, functionality, user experience, etc..etc..etc.. Whatsapp should be less ignorant. Whatsapp should be retired. It doesn't conform to the standard simular apps."
5,"This is the Best Messaging / Social Media App Ever!‚≠ê Experience is so relaxing or smooth and the good thing about this app is, it is even selling on Microsoft Store! Now i can call my family from my PC as well! Another thing is, this app doesn't only use Mobile Data. Instead, it can also call people even on WiFi! üì∂ Easy 5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê."
1,Seriously whatsapp channels are really annoying. You know there are lot of messaging apps out there. But most people use whatsapp because simple and it feel comfortable to use because user friendly easy. But now i kind a hate it. Really annoying when there is lot of things.
4,It is good app and we can easily communicate with everyone and also sometimes it makes study easier. The way this app is updating it is marvelous and I hope that more useful updates will be available which will make communication system more easier.
2,The recent update has channel section in status/updates of whatsapp which is really irritating. The normal status was good for user perspective. Please try to add tab for the channel section. Don't show it just below the status section. Humble request to what's app team.
1,"The new emoji interface is nonsensical and heavily flawed on my device. It renders the proper use of WhatsApp impossible, is irritating and tedious. It is hard to believe that such a flawed product has passed a proper testing campaign before being released...or hasn't it?"
5,"I am so satisfied with this app.. satisfaction is on another level and i can't even explain in words. Like new feature, that is screen sharing is just amazing. But i just want one more thing. As there is option of sharing live location upto 1 hour and 8 hours only and it should be extended to 24 hours if possible ü§£"
1,When I do video call mic doesn't work of this app or I can't hear from the person on the call. Now it's happening for a week I uninstalled and installed it again. Still problem..
1,"Hello everyone, with latest update i am facing some issue, i usedto share multiple file/photos from an application on whatsapp status, but now it dispkays error ""can't send empty massage"". Only one item i can share from the same application. But cant share multiple picture/files."
1,"After updating to the latest version of this app, the app itself started hanging and it's not functioning well on my phone. It keeps stopping in its own whenever am on it. My device is not hanging but the app is hanging. Kindly Rectify."
3,"The new update for the emoji keyboard has a bug. When you have the normal keyboard on screen and when you switch back to emoji keyboard, only the text box moves up and the emoji keyboard stays the same. It looks awkward. but when you close the keyboard and click on the emoji switch, the keyboard moves to the top. Fix it.. and honestly we don't need this change"
2,"what happened with the backup system. have been battling with the backup system three days now,it keeps downloading and stop even me having bundle,it's wasting my bundle,it wasn't like this before,so,y now. please do something about it it's very stressing"
4,Everything is perfect but the camera is pathetic. I would also love to use whatsapp more of they add a feature for auto message in which the msg will automatically be sent to whom u want to send at the desired time just as telegram offers
1,"Because WhatsApp uses fingerprint only as a method of verification, and my phone's fingerprint sensor is not working, therefore I am not able to access whatsapp web because before I can scan the QR for connecting to WhatsApp web, WhatsApp on mobile wants me to verify using fingerprint only, which my phone can't do and there is no other way, So i won't be able to use WhatsApp web now for the rest of my phone's life. Add more ways to verify WhatsApp."
1,"My WhatsApp account has been hacked several times. My DP changing automatically. I could not see the Messages sent to me but it was read by some one. And what's app could not rectify it yet. Frequently asking 2 step verification. Now I am unable to open my whatsApp account. Now my what's app account is being locked and asking to download original version. Even after I downloaded from Play Store, I am unable to open what's app."
1,"Why is it so hard to switch to another phone what's up with the whole ""can't send an sms because you've logged in recently with this number"" it's so annoying and why are the waiting times so long to request another sms I have had a hard time (3 days) trying to switch to another phone and still haven't been able? Fix this!!!!!(I would give 0 starts if I could)"
1,"While uploading status, if I trim the video to a certain part, the video is trimmed but the audio is not. The sync is always missing when I trim the video for status. This bug is there for a long time. When will you fix it?"
1,"stop adding too many features, keep it simple messaging app. Otherwise sooner or later I am going to uninstall it . With every useless update pushing me to do so. Now that'whats that follow features. Useless channel."
5,"Everything is good and perfect from texting to call, but here is a request to introduce groups option seperately as a new icon. It will be much helpful to get groups seperately and chats will not mix with groups that is a big trouble sometimes üòê"
1,Remove this Channel feature... bring back the previous version. Or separate the Status and Channel section..we can't forward multiple status at a time... can't check all views on statuses at once.
1,"This new update is trash, I can't search for status updates of anyone that I need to view their updates. It's frustrating having to start scrolling down to look for updates. Please bring back the search option for status updates."
1,I am using WhatsApp from last 7 years but suddenly it's uninstall in my phone. Last 15 days i am trying to activate my WhatsApp but when i tried and enter my number verification code not getting and massage show me we can't reach and send SMS try after 1 hour. This massage comes from last 15 day. I am send mail many times but not satisfied response from whatsapp team and not solve my problem. If you have time in your busy schedule solve my problem.
3,i prefer the previous interface for the sticker segmentation because it's easier to be looked at as it have categories. this is so hard to look at which stickers i want to choose as it's on scroll mode.
4,"I have been trying to update my WhatsApp for days now but could not scale through.Its very annoying as l'm missing some many things both in business and some other things.l tr ied uninstalling as suggested, powering device off and on all to no avail. You people should do something about it and many are complaining of same issue .No rating for now"
2,"I updated to v2.23.13.76, immediately noticed that it's unable to send videos with or without cutting, same video I could cut/edit and send just before the update. My ph's OS is Android 6.0.1 on Qualcomm MSM8992. I'm yet to discover other issues."
1,"I'm not a fan of the latest update. Why make the emoji layout even smaller? Why flip everything so the back button is now in the middel of the screen? Also, the WhatsApp filters on story photos isn't working anymore. The update is rubbish."
3,New sticker tray is too slow to open. I don't know if it's an animation speed issue or an actual delay. However it's an action I'm using it constantly so it needs to be instant.
1,Last seen Glitch. Notification problem.. And privacy settings is disgusting... We want to keep our profile pic and abouts and lastseen private.Please provide the only share to this contact option.. I think my contacts except option is ridiculous.. When u save a number u have to again go to privacy settings and do all the stuffs again...So please introduce only share to this contact option for every thing just like status only share...
1,"I installed whatsapp on my mobile phone and they have been telling me to use the official whatsapp to be able to use my account even when the official whatsapp is what i am using, i have even tried to log in using another phone but i keep getting the same error message, this is over a month now. There is nothing i haven't done, i even sent an email but nothing was done"
1,"This new version that has WhatsApp channels is annoying, I can't even see contacts whose statuses I've muted anymore, not to mention how uninterested I am in those channels, the worst."
1,"The issue I am currently facing is that when I attempt to download WhatsApp from the Play Store as instructed, it does not allow me to proceed further. After downloading the app through the Play Store, I am prompted with a message stating that I need to download the original WhatsApp application. This has caused significant inconvenience for me as I have important work-related queries and conversations on WhatsApp. I would like to emphasize that I have followed all the necessary steps and proce"
3,"All Over all the things are good but i am facing only and only one issue that when i chosse a video from gallery and upload it on status. The pixels of video becomes damaged. The other person see my status the video result was not clear.please solve this issue as soon as possible.. Regard,, Waleed Sabir"
4,"Ok, so its WhatsApp and everyone knows it works I'v had it on my phone for years like everyone else I suppose, recently it became possible to install WhatsApp on my Samsung watch but within a week I noticed I stopped getting WhatsApp notifications on my watch, I tried everything to get it to work but in the end the only thing that worked was to log my watch out of my WhatsApp as a connected device, not really a problem as no one really uses their watch to actually send a WhatsApp just a shame"
5,"it's and amazing app for communicating with friends and families,I can also share my moment with my friends and families. the problem is,I updated the app 3 times now, and still no changes and it's keeps saying to update, again and again ,why am I updating the app then, when it's changes is still the same?!"
3,My experience is good but honestly i suggest to provide us p√¨n code lock feature on specific chat. this will make it more private as somehow finger print lock is unsafe. Also archived chats should be remain archived until the user can do unarchived.
3,New settings are good. But some videos are not uploading on whatsaap status. These videos are only uploaded when the status privacy settings switch from only contacts you wanted to show status to my contacts. Please fix that bug in new version.
2,"Questionable privacy despite their reassurances. Video compression is extreme and makes videos look like they're 360p. I understand data is expensive, but this level of compression is ridiculous."
5,"It is very secure and safe but, i have only one issue and the issue is that the status puting time very less, it is only 30 seconds and i have the videoes at least 45 or 50 seconds, so my point is to enlarge the status puting time, thnak you"
3,"The redesigned sticker tray is a huge downgrade. The ‚Äútransition‚Äù is very annoying, especially when previously the tray would appear instantaneously. It also plays with the textbox making it all so very awkward"
1,"Nce upon a time I could restore and sign into a new device and have everything be there but why is it that now days every time I sign into a new device I loose ALLLLLLL my messages, voice notes, videos, pictures and even contacts? This is RIDICULOUSLY frustrating and just tiresome.... can we go back to the days where we got everything onto the new device with no issues? I have lost so many important files and work documents because of this.... Upgrade that !!!"
1,"Wth is wrong ith your guys, its been so many years we were accustomed to clicking the emoji backspace button at the bottom corner and now you've move it to the top corner, thats grert üëç i congratulate you on making a significant difference that will make out typing light speed, we just have to adjust to it right üëç, is there anything more like this you'd wanna change like maybe get the keyboard at the topmost section of the screen? white image when talking photo with flashlight not fixed still"
5,"It is the best app I had seen in communication. We can sent any important files also from WhatsApp. I like the ""Avatar Emojis""üëèüèª. We can send now HD photos ü•≥. We can create a Group or any Community. We can know what is the interest of the people by Polling. In WhatsApp There are so many security features. We can set who can our profile photo can be seen or status."
3,"The new version is irritating, videos sent on my status keep staging and some are sent without volume. I am forced to delete the status and post again which sometimes work sometimes does not. Work on this error ASAP"
1,"Why tf does it decide not to turn on the screen AT ALL when I'm on a call? I guess it has something to do with it blacking out when you put it on your ear but then even pressing the on and off button doesn't turn it on. Hell, holding the power button don't even restart the phone"
1,Recent update is useless. WhatsApp is used for personal messaging. What should I do with those useless channels which are of no use. And they are occupying space which was earlier for 'status'. You have totally messed up this recent update. Donno which hopeless person brought this new update üò°üò°üò°
1,The app is good with features but it crashes as many times as i try to open it for using. Even message and calls notifications are missed due to frequent crashes. I have 4 other whatsapp accounts on different devices but all are facing same issue.
1,WORST UPDATE EVER what is the need of channels in whatsApp..it's a messenger application...if you want to put the channels on whatsApp Then give it a separate column and also give option to remove it....don't merge it with status..please fix these problem as soon as possible.
4,This would be an amazing app but there is a few things that could be added.Adding a live option would be so Great! Also adding a reels option for when we're bored this will increase our whatsappp app usage and would be good for the company! Thank you
5,"This app is perfect. When i video call with someone, i can text someone else! Thank you so much i give a 10. And the emojis is super cute! And i can update all and lots of stuff. I dont really need the channels at all."
1,Can't use the app without sharing your entire contacts list. There's no reason I shouldn't just be able to put in a couple numbers or usernames and massage just those people without giving Facebook access to a list of every person I've ever met
1,New updates are ruining the user experience. Atleast add a specific setting to enable/disable it. Not everyone wants to follow a celebrity even on WhatsApp. They are not that great. Keep it simple and minimalistic.
3,"Hi, developer team! One suggestion for upcoming update. Please add This feature to Whatsapp, through which we can save documents or any other file directly from Whatsapp in the desire place within phone memory or SD card , for easy accessibility to these file in the future. Because some time students,, forget where the file(pdf,ppt etc) is present in the study group,within Whatsapp. We are waiting for this feature in The upcoming update. Thanks in advance for considering my suggestion."
5,"Fabulous for video calls to partner who lives long distance, and my family, and keeping intouch with other friends. It's much better than Messenger as to video calls on that kept breaking up looked like a patch work quilt most of the time. I use my data I have no other means no WiFi etc. I use this more than say Gmail. Keep up the good work üëçüèª"
3,It's okay but most of the times my data doesn't work on the app and I have checked everything in my settings that could cause it you may have new messages that what is written in the notification but it's not showing my messages or showing I'm online but other apps work like why network nor they reach my side and my phone goes off anytime I want to hear a voicenote like wassup y'all should improve I got nice experiences but the update is not functioning properly please work on your update üôè
5,It has many crashs . I want to see the 10th day ago message but it is very crashing and the videos pausing and if I cut it from between and then again opening it the video is crashing and not opening clearly üò°üòëüò°üò° please make an update for this .
1,"Very bad experience since the release of channel as it is very annoying for those who don't want them, There is no option to hide it. Therefore bring an option to hide channel's."
1,Latest update is really bad the emojy dont work properly. Should be kept as they were earlier. Also the keyboard doesn't appear when a message is swiped right to reply to. The worst update so far.
3,"I Don't know why It's happening to me. Does It's a glitch of app or problem of my device. Everytime I've sending messages, the messages Doesn't Going immediately. Like its waiting for a while. A single grey tick mark appearing only. Why? Though the both device are connected with Internet. Please solve it immediately. Thanks a lot to WhatsApp Dev Team."
3,"With my contacts all fine. But they send me messages with files attached and call me from Spam numbers and I have no option to block them :( Just add an option to right click a missed call or a new message-link with a blocking option, like it should be in the year 2023."
5,"I always believe whatsapp is the best end to end encrypted way of communication and it is very convenient for me..... And people might not notice it's worth until they compare it like if I compare it with insta I feel using whatapp way easy than insta after I ran out my per day net data....I can easily send texts, photos, videos and voices on whatsapp after I ran out my data bt insta takes too much time in sending"
5,"Everything is good but make changes with small small pieces like rotation of images everytime repetitive steps... Why don't you put an option for that title bar(chats, groups, calls) whether we want it up or down Who want it up will keep it up an others will keep down..."
1,"I have been trying to verify my phone number fot the past 3 weeks, but all in vein. I don't recieve verification code and couldn't call for voice verifications. I have tried in 3 different devices."
1,"What's with this new and useless update of channels? I have no intention of using this nor do I want to even see it. Same goes for all my family members. Please, let us know how we can delete this?! If not, we'll simply use different communication options!"
5,"1. When someone sends a phone number in a chat, we can call that number over whatsapp only. But the feature of dial with phone dialer must be added. So that we dont have to copy & paste the number to dialer to call that number over cellular network. 2. Why we can't hit enter to write in the next line in the description while sending a photo??"
1,"Please roll down the recent update in which you had done some changes for the keyboard.every time I try to share a emoji the animation starts playing , which is disturbing. I suggest you to remove the animation where the emoji section popup appearing from bottom, to cover the delay and give smooth experience to the fast Typers."
1,"Bad User Experience. Search time is increased from the last 2 weeks. Whenever I forward, search, share from other apps, the contacts loading time is too long. It creates very bad user experience. Please check your searching algorithms and/or loading time to fix this issue."
5,"It's a very good application overall, one point that's i want to just suggest that, there should be a search option in WhatsApp status, from which we can search any perticular person seen the status of not from direct search menu in addition to share or delete option. Regards"
1,"I wont even give them 1 star because they app keeps on removing my number for no reason, but i must give a star or i wont be able to post this comment. Google play store must remove Whatsapp from their Google play store platform till all bugs are fix, let Whatsapp can feel how it feels to wast your time with something that doesn't work right."
4,"You show the only day of the continue week. But you should also show the day with the date also. For example, today is Wednesday. You should show this as: Wednesday 23 August 2023. It should be more easier and convenient for users. Because sometimes we manage our things by date and sometimes with day name. There will be both day name and date as well as. Hope you understand. Thank you."
1,"My relative not able to use WhatsApp as it's showing that your account has been blocked, but it's used by someone else as business account....how this possible.... It's been 2 month and still you guys not active that account and now I'm seeing that someone else is using that.... it's really pathetic service."
1,"Awful, I tried to phone my bank and when adds pop up they block your call when switching apps to see statements on the bank app and they can't hear me. after waiting for a long time on hold for a customer service age and then loose the conversation, now I am going to be looking for an alternative phone calling app."
3,"1. In groups, there should be individual option whether to show photo for chats or not...Its really confusion sometimes. Previously untill photo shown feature in group chats wwas not there, it looks good. Atleast provide an option whether to show group chat with photo or without photo at individual level."
1,"The latest update is not good. Why did you move the emoji/stickers/GIF panel from the bottom of the keyboard to the top? For a long-term user, this is annoying. Also, when I click on a sticker, the stickers keyboard glitches. Please fix."
1,"I dont update WhatsApp, coz i know WhatsApp update breaks its layout, and now it forceably told me to update else u cant use it. And now after updating, its a disaster, know first of all square dp, and on clicking announcement grp, list of Grps come rather than showing messages, also showing user picture on the extreme left, takes much space and is ruining experience. Thanks for the uodate"
1,"Keeps re-downloading old media from chats that (should be) deleted, as I have no access to them. Every time I delete them from my device, but they keep showing up. The settings for downloaded media are all switched off. If these chats are allegedly gone, where does this media keep coming from? Absolutely unacceptable."
1,"There's something wrong with the timestamp shown for calls. There's a lag. Calls I made earlier still appear as ""now"" on the log meanwhile they were made several minutes prior. Calls I just received or made sometimes don't even show at all till after several minutes..of which the timestamp still don't tally till after some hours. With this, I can't properly tell the exact time a call was made to me or I sent out a call till after some hours. Please, kindly fix this"
1,"after the contacts update, all my contact's name suddenly cant be saved and renamed. Can you make the statuss like it used to? who tf using channels just delete that option"
2,"While sharing video or image and uploading it to status , the quality of video or image reduces to almost zero, there was an option in whatsapp to choose best media quality but now it's gone, whatspp should allow users to share videos and photos with best quality Hd 1080p quality or 720p atleast, in the era of 1440p ,2160p whatsapp is giving it's user 144p quality... üòû"
1,Extremely bad quality video call with even bad audio. My Internet connection is working fine. The problem is with the app. Noise between calls and very low voice on call.
1,Updates are getting annoying because whenever I try to update status in video format I am facing issues like video getting stuck and the continuation of video in second status the audio is not matching and video as usual getting stuck. Now it's irritating alot.
4,"Hello app is excelent but it have one big thing that I personaly dont like, if I am out and I don't hawe internet connection when I get back on line app is constantly giving me message by message and when I get 150 messages it get pretty anoing it woud be nice if I get single notification that say you have 10 or 3 messages that I need to see + I have smart watch so it can get pretty anoing, I can't do anything on the watch all that I can do is turn off Bluetooth so my watch woud stop ringing."
5,"I use WhatsApp daily and have never had a problem, but for some reason I can't change my profile picture anymore. Everytime I try to, the app glitches out of the menu and I can't change it at all. I'm using it on a S21 Ultra. Would love some help with this."
1,Hey this new update (14th aug) is kinda ruining the experience.... App behaves weirdly in terms of 1. Kepboard auto popping for typing. 2. Irregular positioning and layouting at times Probably its the material design which is yet not in place. Whatsapp will. Always have 5 star rating from my end. This is for the new update
4,Review for WhatsApp on watch version: Noticed that the stickers were not animated and the photos shared can't be clicked to enlarge. Hope that there will be an update for these features in the future üòÅ. However it is great that there is an app available for the watch currently üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
5,"My WhatsApp account was temporary suspended and after 24 hours, I received a notification that my account has been restored. But when I tried to register afresh, it keep telling me that "" You need official WhatsApp to use this account"" and that my phone number could not be verified. But this is the number I have been using on What sAp for close to a decade now. I tried severally but it kept telling me the same thing. This number is important to me on Whatsapp. Please, help resolve it. Thank you"
2,"The redesigned sticker tray of the 2.23.16.76 Version is honestly difficult for me to use. Hence, no improvement whatsoever of my navigation. The previous setup was better. It's more clean for sure but still difficult to adapt to"
1,"Currently I am having a problem and that is people whom I had deleted from my contacts had started seeing my status ,how is that even possible? I don't have their number anymore saved in my phone or on Google backup. Still when I am seeing how many people has seen my status the names of the deleted contacts are popping up. Please it's a request tell me how can I solve the issue."
2,"On this latest update, why is whatsapp not showing names of some contacts. Especially contacts I have saved with two names it is showing number and the second name. Some contacts are only appearing as numbers. I have granted permission to contacts, refreshed contact list like a millions times but still the same problem."
3,"The new feature is a stress, swiping to watch status was better as compared to tapping on it now. And I'm not a fan and comfortable with where the features were moved to, makes it difficult as compared to easy and looks too big at the bottom. In fact it's not a nice ideaüòè. I wish i had skipped this update, you have to tap on everything now, which is soo annoying üò¢"
1,The new update doesn't work clearly. Specially in gif images. We can't select one gif image and we can't go down to select gif images. If we try to go down to find gif image suddenly it disappear and come to first page. Please solve this problem
1,"It is boring whatsapp now considering the channels are confusing, I personally don't understand why I need them when I already have Google. Please remove this new update! And one thing that is making it more horrible is status tab why replace it with channels?? You all together need to drop this features out of whatsapp!"
2,"Before the update, the apps working well. Then, after few update from whatsapp. Problem start with updating status. When send to status, the video cannot be uploaded and keep asking for retry also Happened when video is trimmed, if not trimmed it will work just fine."
5,The service is simply getting better and better each and every time... super!!!... whatsapp's innovative gesture of creating an endless array of possibilities in enhancing customers' ultimate satisfaction in elevating the level of communication and interaction is sooo awesome and indeed invaluable... simply the best.
5,"i just notice theres a new features where we can msg ourself a to-do list, its good but can u add date and time too, where people can send themself a msg for example to remind them about a doctor appointments in 2 weeks time, that will be a good add to whatsapp i tell ya, if u find it useful and a great idea, msg me and gimme a gift as a token of appreciation for the idea.. =D"
1,Wadda heck. This app is overheating my phone.... Media not downloading anymore?!?! Are the devs drunk or smth? Also When i give permission to your app to use my phone camera the iris scanner on my s8 stops working. So I have to remove permissions and clear cache and restart phone. I hope you fix it soon to give better rating.
1,"Having worst experience in this app, it's been more than a month that I am unable to use my whatsapp, whenever I try to download it it's says you need to use official Whatsap and this unable me from using it, no matter how many times I downloaded this app it shows the same error, it's my request to the official of whatsapp to sort my issue out as soon as possible."
4,"Good overall experience. But you cannot send HD videos. The quality decreases! Also, video call quality is not very nice, even when I've high speed internet..."
1,"As usual you took an app that works perfectly and f it up. We dont need stupid keyboard animation or change in there. We need speed and efficiency. Which is something we dont have anymore. What's the point of changing emoji gif section? Seriously asking. It takes forever to upload now. Soooooo annoying. Status section is completely unnecessary.And unlike old times, you're not the only messenger app anymore. So you should do your best and do something USEFUL if you want to keep your users in!"
4,"Need an option to hide/ unhide chats or lock chats with a password option. Archived chats can be unachievable. (‚òÜ_ _ _ _ ) Update - Thank you for the update with the chat-lock option with fingerprint. Now, my only concern is why the locked chats folder is visible on top? (This will let the people know that I have hidden chats) (‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ_ _ ) Update - Thank you very much for the update! I have one more problem with whatsapp; the photos and videos uploaded in chats / status in low quality."
3,"HATE the new emoji keybord. The ""back"" key is suddenly at the top instead of the bottom?? Emoji's change position WHILE USING so if you're not paying attention you end up using the wrong one which could cause very awkward conversations. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD KEYBOARD!!! I never write reviews so this shows how much I hate it."
4,"I use this app on a daily basis and haven't run into any issues. I work night shifts, though, and sometimes can't text people right away as it's too early in the morning, so a 'timed message' feature would be very helpful. Similar to a scheduled mail just setting the time and date for a text to be sent so I don't have to worry about forgetting/texting too early"
1,"Latest update causes an error message whenever I try to send a video: something like ""Can't send this video, try another video"". Searching for GIFs also refuses to load results"
2,"WhatsApp for Wear OS is finally available which is good BUT latest version 2.23.14.81 does NOT notify or alert me of any incoming Whatsapp messages on my galaxy watch in LTE standalone mode, despite the WA app notifications already turned on in the app notification settings. To ensure I don't miss any important incoming WA messages, I have to manually open my WA app on my watch every 5 mins, which is ludicrous ! Please fix this issue asap, thank you !!"
4,"The best texting app ever made... Just wanted to add that, earlier i could see the groups in which i was in (in my self number i.e. Message Yourself) but after last update i am unable to see the same, it was a nice feature that could keep my groups in which i am in, handy.. Kindly incorporate the same in next update."
5,its better app one can talk with his/her belongings without any problem and hesitation. Statuses should be downloaded over wifi mode without being online. It should have airplane mode too.
1,Can't download any backups due to have NO INTERNET. It's very sad that your options for accessing back ups are WIFI ONLY. If you guys offer more then that you need to fix your app as it's pretty sad when I do not have internet and can't use my data to access what I want.
2,"Since the update, the app has been gitching when using it on ""pop-up window"" mode on some Samsungs, forces you to open it in full-screen which messes with productivity if you're still busy on the main screen."
3,"New emoji GUI is bad, bringing sections in one long scrolldown makes harder to find something in the middle or end of one specific section, the design itself left less space for finger taps aka for user writing AND the emoji menu now always appears with recently used, for example i always left it on face category."
4,"Overall good but I would like to suggest a new option regarding ""screen sharing"" in the video call option it would be sooo much better if the other person could also hear audio of the video playing while ""screen sharing"""
3,Although I love the app I don't like the fact that it does not have notification that notifies that a message has come through in Samsung Galaxy note ultra 5g. I have to constantly check manually to make sure I have not missed a message.
1,Just stop it with this Instagram UI pasting all over all Meta applications! No one wants channels in their private messenger. Why you ruin a perfect product. There's a difference between a messaging app and a social media app. You need to understand that. Horrible update.
2,Please let be simple as it is previously. Please remove that Updates Tab and keep it as Status Tab only and Sticker tray is better previously. Now it is just messed up with WhatsApp. I used to use WhatsApp more then any other app & I request you to keep it simple please. So that it is easy to use.
3,"Good but have some few issues with it ,when I want to forward a message it take more than 30min for me to be able to forward a message to someone else which makes it difficult for me. I will be glad if you can do something about it . And also for instence if a message is being sent through a group I can't be able to read the message but it rather goes to the bottom making it difficult for me because I have to scroll up to go and read the message one after the other .pls same issue help please"
4,"Does what is does. Innovation has slowed, but that's okay, a stable version is better than something new. What I would however like, is higher picture and video quality. My wide angle shots look like Game Boy Super Mario resolution."
2,"Outdated UI and ads incorporated into the app. WhatsApp is not the best anymore. RCS still has a long way to go; I think Signal or Telegram are a better deal right now, especially if you can convince your friends to switch over."
1,"two backups lost now! When my phone crashed last year, i could not get the backup to restore to the repaired phone. That was bad enough. Now when i tried to transfer my backup to a new phone, i couldnt find my encryption key, and once you start the transfer, there's no turning back, even though there was supposed to be a backup on Google Drive. Its pretty stupid that WA's supposed security features actually prevent legitimate users from accessing their data. Stupid stupid stupid."
1,I have just updated my whatsapp....as you indicated the old version is expiring. Then up pop the new feature that I can send myself a message. Surprise! The profile name that comes up is not me. It i dicates Carolyn Menger????!!!!!!.
2,Downloaded WhatsApp on my new phone. No icons when you receive a message. No pop ups when you are receiving a call. Checked notifications and pop up notifications are no longer available for my version of android.
3,"Since new update, when swiping to reply keyboard no longer comes up automatically. Please fix. Consecutive play of voice messages is not preferred this feature should be an option that the user is allowed to turn off or on."
5,"Can you please add a search button on the update side, I mean we are unable to search for status updates by searching a person name. And we can't also delete all our status updates by marking all of them at once... Otherwise everything could be fine"
1,"While using whatsapp, it crashed and even after updating to new version, it is not responding and crashing again before I can read and send my massages. I've lost many important business massages. I'm not sure if I reinstall it , I can recover my massages and conversations. Do you have any advise?"
4,I want to say that the app works very well and just I want that you must introduce a new feature in status like Instagram when we add story we have music option we need a similar in WhatsApp so that we don't need to get that photo add some music from another app and then send on our status
1,"Can't share full video as status. I mean yes I can share first 30 seconds part of video as status, the problem is I can't share the second part of video and so on. It is says ""Can't send this video. Choose a different video and try again."" athough it came from the same video as the first status. Tried to update WhatsApp to the newest version and the problem still persist."
1,"So the other day when Whatsapp updated and I log on , looking in the call logs that I have for a very long time , ago but then what I saw was that half of my numbers on the call log was deleted?? how is that possible also some of the numbers on my phone aren't saved so that where I look for it. Whatsapp can you please do something about this because I need people to call."
5,"This app is actually a very good messqging platform, one of the best actually. But for the end to end encryption for those messages that aren't in view. I don't see why we that updated our Whatsapp won't be able to see some messages because other's didn't"
1,"By clicking app info>notification setting and call history from apps, locked chat number became reveled. Call and video quality is not good enough too much pause in video and microphone on mobile network, perhaps disappearing time for message could be customizable Like messanger apps. Locked chat not hiding and while opening app locked chat opened."
1,"JUST Terrible; every time, every updates!!! with a super Low security. ""Telegram"" is the best ever! At least you can analyze it and learn from it ..."
1,"App is good but need a very imp update since very very long time I was hoping what'sapp will realise & fix it but they never know it..The prblm is when the sender sends or forwards multiple pics or pdf or messages @ a time , then on receivers what'sapp they all will be shuffled & mixed as garbage..plz fix or else the sender has to continue what he is doing for a decade(individual sending one after another)"
1,"The new Emoji UI is absolutely horrendous. I hate everything about it. The animation is slow to open the emoji keyboard. I also don't like that the emojis are constantly reshuffling based on my latest emoji selection, making me constantly press the wrong emoji. Please bring back the old UI"
2,I've been using this app for years and used to be happy . My Samsung is up to date and the latest update of this app has removed my notifications. Now I have to open the app just to see if there is a message waiting. In settings the notifications area is greyed out
5,"It's been great so far. But there are several glitches in the recent updates; we need the emoticons back in the pictures to be sent, I've missed that arrow that indicates üòâ. Captions under forwarded media files are not sent with the files, they sends separately even on status updates posted. The filter to the media files shared (especially pictures) makes it look blurry.‚òπÔ∏è. Backing up to cloud üå• has not been that easy, especially for those with heavy chat histories. We need these get correced."
4,A great appnfor communication. A new feature that is view once is also great but someone has taken SCREENSHOT when I sent a photo at VIEW ONCE. So it will be better if whatsapp added a feature of not taking SCREENSHOT in VIEW ONCE feature. ~Thank You.
2,"Instead of improving and adding useful functions it takes them away. Now you can't press on the name or number of a person in a group and message them directly... it now shows you their picture, so you have to look them up in the long list of group members if you want to contact that person in private. Then, how come they didn't yet add the function of scheduling messages?!? It's so useful for busy people and for those times when you remember too early or too late in the day to message someone."
1,"The status trimming is not appropriate. While trimming a video for status, the uploaded ststus is not the part that I trimmed and also the audio and video doesn't sync. This bug is there for a long time and never got fixed."
1,"A hate that the archive files are now on the top. I preferred it at the very end of the chats. Also when I mute someone's story I want it to be completely hidden. There is no point in the mute feature if you can just scroll down and find them. I prefer it to be completely hidden, I mute people's status with that intend only. Maybe put them along with archive files right at the bottom of chats. Otherwise it's a great app."
3,Compression algorithm is so poor that even the highest quality picture or video taken becomes so bad when those are put up for Status. Downloading or uploading picture is not smooth. It gets stuck quite a lot of times.
4,"Feedback: Whenever I share a contact using the attachment option, the name and number in my contacts list gets directly sent. It would be useful if there is a way to edit the name before i send the contact info. Eg I would have saved my college professor as John EEE - Electromechanical but when I need to send this to someone I would ideally send the name as John. So please give this option to edit name before sending"
5,Add support for Samsung keyboard. Sometimes I have to send stickers which are exclusive to my Samsung Keyboard but the transition or animation doesn't looks good. Hope you will do something
1,Such pathetic app. I have been receiving fraud messages since 2 week after I acxepted their terms and conditions. They mentioned that any business can contact you but I have been receiving fraud lottery messages. And inspite of complaining the support team is of no help to me.
3,What is wrong with you guys that you are taking away the so called privacy by adding a new feature of channels. It should be optional for everyone to choose that they want to have that section in status part or not.
3,"Please do NOT touch features and layouts that are not broken. I'd have previously given this app 5 stars, but today's update changed the emoji/gif/sticker layout and made it backwards for no reason??? I've been using your app for nearly 10 years now and never have I been this annoyed by an update."
3,My whatsapp had updated and was supporting whatsapp channels. I even created 3 new channels. But suddenly the whatsapp reverted back to the old one and now i can no longer post on my channels. I cant even see the channels. My followers can see the channels though. Kindly help. Ibe tried reaching out on whatsapp support but only a bot responds to my querry with irrelevant information.
2,"Goof features, yet you lose quality on a video if it is over 16MB . I sent a UHD video of 23MB, and it looks like it was recorded on VHS camera. That's why Telegram is still better."
2,"Everything is going well until when I change my device now both video call and voice call is not connecting and I have contacted the service provider but they didn't do anything about it, so annoying"
5,The new layout is looking good at the moment I do love it but I would love to suggest something. I think there should be a notification area that inform users about unread chats. Thank you by the way the layout is awesome
5,Excellent..but few things need to be improved. 1. Photo quality...poor... 2. Option to take WhatsApp back without wifi is not possible. Or atleast I m not able to find one in VIVO V27. Please guide me to get this. 3. How do I share multiple chats transfer to emai in one go ? Currently I am able to do one at a time.
1,"App constantly playing up when try replying in the notification bar and it just spins, when I get a call even though I'm on the call the whole time it comes up saying incoming call, so many bugs since last update please fix this"
4,"My voice calls don't work they can't hear me for 2 months.is a new phone.don't really call anyone.. all permissions allowed,,deleted cache, uninstall then install etc.. still don't work.. video works with no sound,voice notes work,text works, regular phone calls work..they can hear me"
3,Great app. But is it possible to make a way unlock the app with pin if the fingerprint is not working? I turned fingerprint locking on and wasn't able to sign in for a long time because the sensor wasn't working.
1,"New Updated WhatsApp don't allows us to search WhatsApp Status if i want to recheck it of any member its not showing any option, i will have to go to his profile and will have to check it again not as smooth as old one direct search option was best. I cant view my status directly in new update, i will have to watch my all status from beginning if even i just wanted to view my last status."
1,No good. This keeps deleting numbers that I have stored. The chats are backed up but no names or numbers assigned. I have a daily backup and nothing works since these new updates were introduced. It's got a mind of its own and I have gone from 1151 contacts to 498 contacts and it seems to have its own mind when to synnch and not. Massive security liability here.
1,"Sticker and emoji tray still a mess after the latest update, messages disappear when selecting emojis, can't see what was selected until back typing text or about to send... How about fixing this in the next update..."
4,"Can u enable multiple items such as images and PDFs selected to be exported / shared to Gmail as att , it ll be great. Now I need to go to file manager and then do it.If watsapp could bring this feature, nothing like that .Hats off for your ongoing good work."
3,It is much more better if you can develop whatsapp for connect airpods through bluetooth during a call further. In current version it cannot be done. Time slot allocated to status is very less. That's annoying.
1,"I HATE IT!! You removed the option of viewing the entire statuses like a gallary. With 50 posts, I have to remove them one by one instead of selecting how many I can delete. I DON'T CARE about the channels, but put back the album view of the status, please"
1,Only one thing will dissopoint me always. If i try to send lots of videos at a time means (eg. 10 videos) its just loading and sending 50% of all videos then it stops. Even i will try in strong 5g network and WIFI means also it shows like this onlyüò§üò§üò´ I am Totally dissopointed in this problemüòëüòë Hey Whatsapp please do something for a fastest uplodingüòí
3,The new version isn't showing on my device. The amount of times I have updated the app it doesn't show and now with the latest update which is for channels I haven't gotten the feature but I have updated the app
1,"My WhatsApp crashes daily with the following error message ""Something Went Wrong with your Chat History WhatsApp while restoring"" WhatsApp stuck at finishing 99% and if I skip whatsapp mostly crashes with above error message and leads to Preparing for message popup and not loading the recently backups. Loads very old chat histories. If sometimes loads only with messages, Pls help to resolve this issue. Due to this I couldn't use WhatsApp for past 2 weeks. Not even able to use WhatsApp web."
5,"My account is flagged by whatsapp system. I am requesting for past 3 days to reactivate my account as lot of important and urgent messages are on WhatsApp application. But all in vain. Please look into it as lot of people would be suffering like me. It is really very great communication app, and I want to continue using it. So pls reactivate ASAP"
1,It's a good app but when I update this app after updating when I hear a voice clip the loud I don't hear and when I pause between the voice clip then no stop and I click the back button then the voice clip go to the top of screen with continuously
1,It was good a few months back but now everytime during a video call my video is paused without any reason and the only way it can be fixed is for you to call again. There is also a new irritating feature we cannot send photos while on a video call. We cannot check other messages while on a video call or our video will be paused. I don't understand are you trying to increase inconvenience for the user with each update.
3,There is alot of problems in the last update.. When you type and send a reply..it doesn't show up immediately.. it takes a while to show below the conversation... another thing ...when I turn on the mobile data..it takes a while to receive the messages..
4,"The new features added are great but it will be nice if we are able to change the outward theme, font style, have a button to save people's status, be able to set a timer for status posted and have like a little icon indicating someone is online. That will make the app cool ü§û."
3,"My number got blocked (with reason ""due to spam""). I would like to file for a review since I only had to transfer from different devices because of technical problems of my phone and the only messages I sent were to my family and friends. Hoping for a positive response. Thank you."
5,"Whatsapp is a cool very easy to use social messaging app. But it would be alot better if it had the features Gb whatsapp has. After all thats the reason why most users download the official gb whatsapp, because it has a lot of features that people will really need. Like the anti delete message, anti delete status, more options about the read receipts. To sum it all this official version of whatsapp should have features like the gb whatsapp so that people won't download the unofficial version"
1,"I have been using this app my whole life, this has always been the only social media platform that i used, i liked this app because i could use it for important things only. I never had a problem with this app, now youre adding ""channels""?? Its a damn messaging app stop makjng it more, its good as is. I HATE the new update, deleting this damn app. Useless society trying to make everything a competition, can i please just talk to my people in peace"
1,"Channels bad news.Yes I can unfollow. HOW DO I DELETE. I don't want channels.I must UNFOLLOW grps when I NEVER became followers in the 1st place! I don't want the CHANNEL funct, how do I reverse it. You make many great enhancement,but here you fail. It is not working. I unfollow and guess what, back as follow. I rapport and unfollow, guess what back. I have full view of this rubbish and my status is one long line. You say WA safe, so how come all these grps appear and say I follow them."
1,Unable to upload DP's or status in original quality. Everytime i upload something.. The quality deteriorates even for the profile pic. And the biggest problem after update is that i cannot even change a filter of a picture.
4,Am I the only one who has a problem with the textbox disappearing when you try to select and emoji with the new upgrade? It's probably the biggest inconvenience because I have to move the emoji board down to see if the sticker I selected actually does appear on the text box ‚òπÔ∏è
5,"It will be great if the locked chat is not shown when searched in the searching bar, also please make any other method to access the locked chat. For example pressing the ""Chats"" header for 5s would open the locked chats folder."
2,"Whatsapp is a very convenient communication platform until it ruins the quality of our photos and videos when we post on Status. Hence, I gave 2 stars. You guys fix that issue. Everything will be awesome!"
1,It's been a while. Almost every modern social media app has a nice emojis like Instagram and many others. But why the most used app in the world for messaging has outdated Emojis Why? I can't understand. Please update them as soon as possible. I have been waiting for this from years. Please üôè Thank you team.
1,"When I try to join a group with a link, I get: ""Looks like you don't have WhatsApp installed!"" The app IS already installed !!! So, when I click Open, the app opens, but it loses the group to be joined ! So, bottom line, I can't join groups with links! (FYI: I am using Samsung dual messenger feature). Update: Issue has not been resolved!"
4,"It's very good buh my only problem is about the PC version. View once messages can't be accessed on the PC version. Also, someone can view your status and send a message to you directly buh you wouldn't see from your end that the person has viewed your status"
1,"Wrost update with channels. No need this unneccessary thing in status section. There is no way provide to hide channel section. I don't like this functionality. I want to hide channels section from updates, but no way to do that. Hope in next update provide a way to hide channels."
1,"I liked it when it was working, unfortunately recently I have encountered a problem. When I open my account it shows me 'this account is not allowed to use WhatsApp'.. it directs me the procedure to follow and after several hours my account resumes.. after just a couple of hours the same statement comes again; 'this account is not allowed to use WhatsApp'.. I follow the instructions and it resumes again, an hour or two later, the same thing happens.. so it has become like we're playing a game."
1,"when i post videos on my status it doesn't play the full video anymore it's really frustrating, even when i'm watching someone else's status it never plays the full video, it's always cut in half."
5,Hello dear ! Thank you for this good Calling service but there is a little problem The time duration is not shown during the video call on the laptop. Please work on this too thanks ... And there is no option to change the background €î€î€î
4,"My whatsapp does not have the 'Upload data quality' option which sucks, because all the videos I send or put on my status are always of very bad quality. Pls, look into that for me or check for what the problem is."
2,"The community was update? In my app the option to search for people in the community has disapperd, which has made my job a lot more difficult when I need to go and find the person to delete from the community, previously I just serched for the name and was able to delete the list. Now, I have to search the person directly and in the list has 500 people and the list always goes back to the beginning, wasting a lot of time."
1,"Stickers viewing is extremely bad after last updates not working properly with the chat box also it is more complicated and small icons, it was much easier before and easy to type and uae !"
3,"The option to customize WhatsApp to suit preference should be added, like to be able to customize the Ui, font type & color and other things. It'll make it more interesting to use. Thanks"
1,"Impossible to verify phone number. The call message says press a number to receive the code, but hangs up when you do. The SMS message is never sent, and makes you wait an hour between attempts. Utterly unreasonable and completely useless. I'd give -5 stars if I could."
5,"The recent update has a horrible effect on Video call. In a video call, when the camera is changed to the rear one, the video becomes blurry/distorted and can't focus. But the front camera works fine. Please fix this ASAP."
2,"Its been nice, until the second to last update where my voice note recording stops recieving audio for like 5 secs and continues again, then stops recieving and continues, pls fix this issue, I've tested this on other apps to make sure it isnt my device, and i can make 2 min long recordings without interuption"
2,"Since the recent update, i am facing issues with aspect ratio of this app..... Profile picture of last person in the contact list is partially getting cut. Emoji tab tab is malfunctioning, as it's sometimes opening 20% and sometimes 50% and sometimes working fine.... Please do fix"
1,"WhatsApp.. I'm really disappointed in few updates.... First of all....Voice recorder is not working properly, messages get stuck and I am not able to send and I am not able to back-up data at all...Please fix this bugs soon or please restore it to its older form...I don't need stupid unnecessary updates at all. Thank you"
1,"I am not happy with the new updated features. The channel option is annoying. If there is a option to have control of Channel it would be better like in status section I should have the acess to have channel on or off. I don't like seeing channel in any section. I would be happy if the access to have channel option on or off will be in my hand. If there is need I will on the channel or no need I will off it, so it won't be seen anywhere especially in status section. Remove channel option."
1,"Pissed off with the new update. You made it even more distracting. People have Instagram and YouTube for channels and updates. WhatsApp is becoming like them. Kindly allow us a feature to block channels option for people who are not interested. Maybe out of distraction, people will delete this app too."
1,WhatsApp is fugged up after latest update. Don't connect calls quickly and asks for internet connection even after being on an internet connection. The hell is wrong with it. You dev people are just ruining the WhatsApp. Do hell with your channel and updates if basic WhatsApp features are gonna be shiddy like this.
1,"It would be a relief if you can turn emoji and stickers tab like it used to. I hate it when it's auto scrolling down when tapping downloaded stickers pack, and auto scrolling up for favourite and recent stickers."
5,"Best app for message with family, friends & others. But I think all users need search bar in the status views, so users can search anyone easily & see friend view status or not. üëçüèº"
1,"WhatsApp have really messed me up. They keep blocking me from using WhatsApp frequently stating that my account is not üö´ allowed to use WhatsApp due to no reasons at all. I have kept sending reviews. Once am allowed to use WhatsApp again,boom üí•, again banned üö´ from using WhatsApp. I have installed all the apps from google play store but still I keep getting the same issue. The problem reappears again and again despite them answering to me that the issue was by mistake. I loose a lot by this."
1,"Don't install it if you haven't yet . The app was good until facebook bought it. Now I receive spams everyday and no action is taken against any company. All you get is the ability to block but every spam has atleast one chance to disturb you. If you haven't used it yet, please do your self a favour and use better apps like telegram,imessage,etc and save yourself the trouble."
1,"Every 2nd day whatsapp history restored without any reason and i lost my all msgs. What the hell with this new update. It's running very slow, it's taking too much time for searching username. Such a horrible experience. I lost my history few mins back now who is responsible for that?"
1,"sir plz help my whatsapp is not working i have made my personal for it also it is not working since 2 days ‚Ä¢ You can now instantly record and send video messages in chats. To get started, tap on the microphone icon in chats to switch to video. ‚Ä¢ Screen sharing is now supported in video calls. Start a video call and tap on the new ‚Äúscreen share‚Äù button to get started. ‚Ä¢ Added message editing support for media with captions. ‚Ä¢ Updated UI with Material 3 Menus and Switches."
4,"I think a nice feature for the next update could be adding a search item for the date. Like searching for a word or words is already there but I would like to the able to search for a date, e.g 11 July and for it to pop up, Thank you"
4,"Have you ever written something on what up? And then notice that the amazingly beautiful piece of writing is lost? Yeah Than we are mentioning a simple problem what's app can fix to make things better Hope you can fix it boys Love and nothings else but hatred Since we need both to extend the text a bit more One lo be concrete, the other to make people go in rage You need balance As the error that whatsup will fix for us Tha people! Peace out ‚úåÔ∏èüòé"
1,"Last update is very useless and very bad. Im a whatsat status creator and editor. I can't send status videos it's same clarity. I would sent any status they qlarity will loss. Please give the feature for Video uploading the orginal Quality and Clarity. My too many opportunities will missed for this one reason. You will responsible my issue.... If you don't solve my problem. I will quit in WhatsApp. Its my request.Please, the next apdate and make all editors&poors will happy."
1,"The whole app is made for right handed people. I'm lefthanded and if I'm using only my left hand, I can't reach the attachment or voice message icons. I need to constantly use two hands for it. It's such a small thing yet WhatsApp never seems to include and option to toggle these from right to left of screen..."
2,It's definitely a good app. but there is bug that none of the community admins can put a community profile picture it always leads to failure; try again later. kindly fix this issue. I am not facing this issue with normal groups.
4,"It's a great experience with this app. But now I have two issues. 1. I like the idea of locked chats but why is the animation so slow. When I unlock the chat. It's smooth yes, but I don't like the time lag. It should be faster than it is. 2. There's currently some sort of bug that I'm facing. It's this ""wa.me/settings"" message. It crashes WhatsApp anytime u open a chat that has that message. Pls fix these issues. Thanks for your help"
4,"WhatsApp is supposed to be like Telegram, where users can log in and log out anytime and anywhere. This makes it easier for people when they want to switch from WhatsApp to a new phone. Other than that, there might be no problem."
4,"In the latest version of WhatsApp, the addition of channels underneath the status update do not give a good look. Keep the two separately. Thanks"
1,"Features(Bug) List: 1. Smiley page slowed with unnecessary update. 2. Converts video as old school 3GP. 3. Backup & upload process takes 3 hours/1 GB. 4. Old local backup not get identified, rather deleted and lost. 5. PDFs get renamed, extensions get removed. 6. Very slow search in chat. 7. Old media are lost and ask to resend. 8. Scroll bug is introduced recently. 9. Status video plays in background. 10. HTTP proxy does not work. 11. PDF Preview to send gets distorted color."
5,I'm enjoying the app but please can you add a voice/music media file icon beside the voice note icon under status. It shouldn't be a must to do voice notes; one might prefer to upload a choice music instead. Thanks.
1,"Meta Just killed Sanctity and Integrity of WhatsApp with Updates tab and Channels. I think they should have a lite version without these features. I just want my instant messenger back. Not some heavy app that consumes my phone battery, cpu/ram/storage, data and my health finally. Parents won't be able to protect kids with these features. Elders loose track of time and efficiency at work with gimmicks Offices and Educational institutions should ban whatsapp for what it is not now anymore. ü§¨"
4,It's among the best communication apps just missing a few features like sharing statuses from different people to your own and saving the status if you have liked it. I know it may sound rediculous but we need those features ü•∫
2,recently the app has been bugging out a lot and a lot of messages have been coming through saying 'waiting for this message to arrive'. i contacted support and updated the app etc but the messages still haven't arrived. disappointed as i use the app for work.
3,Hey I really like this app and all and have been using it for a very long while but it so happened that my one and only number I've been using for so long has been banned and I'm not allowed to log into whatsapp with that number causing me to have to buy another sim card which I think is ridiculous as I did nothing wrong for my account to be banned. I have many important things on that account that I've now lost because of this. I hope I can have some feedback at least on this matter please.
5,"Very good it helped us a lot in messaging privately than u whatsup.for keeping our privately and being with us for all the time.lt is very helpful app and it is giving us opportunity to meet, talk ,chat and an personal chat it helped me and everyone and is a good app and gives feature of others like about their sharing and it helps us to talk with the people by facing them in a video call. It helps us to share important photos, documents , notes , question paper,answer and so on .............."
4,"Like the most recent updates, especially the sticker tray/picker with the infinite scroll, etc. But it keeps reverting to the old version after a short while. Any way to fix this bug? Thanks."
1,"The latest update is the worst, I just hate the emoji panel. It is super annoying to just open the emoji panel, I just can't write my messages as fast as I could before this. Please go back to the last update or just resolve this issue, it's really annoying. üò≠üò≠"
1,"The recent WhatsApp update is very, very bad by adding these channels in the personal status and changing their settings. We hope that you will return it as it was, and do not play again in the status settings please, as it is very bad and very provocative, don't do this."
5,"I personally complaints so strong I do not have, with the latest update I like the new changes, the integration of the menu for stickers gifs and emojis, although it is true, at least in my device is bugueado, you do not see what you send ahadta what you leave, but minor failures, excellent team"
3,"WhatsApp New feature on my mobile screen - When I tap on the WhatsApp channel updates section to find any channel or to view/see its chat, then only buffering keeps happening on the screen and it closes automatically. Why is this? Please WhatsApp answer."
2,"Please add an option to long-press on send so that we can send a message without sound. Such an important and useful feature. Only pros, no cons. You're losing users to Telegram."
1,The sticker tray is completely unusable now. Very glitchy and buggy. You fixed it back to the old way but now it's back and is terrible!!!! The old tray was very slick. Very disappointing. I can't even use emojis anymore
5,Best app for this kind of stuff hands down and it's free plus sending long videos. Stop complaining to the people that are. You are annoying. Get a better phone if it doesn't work for you or get off your iPhone
5,Very satisfied with the latest update which is the HD button. Now i'm able to send image to anyone with higher resolution. Keep up the good work! üòÅ
2,Hating the update feature by replacing the status feature. WhatsApp was like a personal space for a mankind. But now it's going on with other trends not with it's simplicity. Hating it a lot. Liked the earlier version.
2,"I have experienced one issue after the latest update. Whenever I try to download videos that were sent to me , it takes a while to download, and the status is not loading, even though my internet is totally fine. It's the latest update, which has some bugs that need to be fixed."
1,I am not getting verification code and trying it for 5 hours This is a bad experience for me . And it's not at all responding. If my problem solves I will rate 5 stars .and I have tried all the ways but I didn't get verification code yet.
4,"Facing an irritating problem these days. I have enabled and whenever I take WhatsApp from recent apps, it doesn't open even after my fingerprint is verified. It just gets stuck and i have to close it and open it all over again, every single time."
3,"Seen a lot of Bugs...Not even able to send messages at some appropriate time....And video quality is very bad...In Video Call, not even able to talk for some 5-10 min...It's lagging and Video always gets paused on the other side."
4,"Hey i have a suggestion, if I am in a group everyone can see my messages but maybe you guys make so that some words are only visible to selected members of that group.It's like an option ""always remember"" that one. You guys could maybe put that option besides the ""send"" button or if I hold the ""send"" button."
1,WhatsApp has turned into a joke. There is nothing personal left in this useless app. Getting messages from businesses without permission. And now the channels. This app sucks. If I can give 0 stars I would have given that.
4,Dear WhatsApp @meta.... The new feature....I mean the navigation bar is below now... which is problematic. The screen area became smaller and it is difficult to find previous chats. And overall...it is uncomfortable and looks is not good. It's a request... please provide previous one. ~ A regular user....
1,What's app is not working on Android 8.0.0. they have banned the account without reason. Tried mobile formatting Mobile device and uninstalling the all apps and reinstall. But the issue is with what's app not üö´ working at all. Lots of bugs are there.
1,"I can't use this version because it has many bugs. Incorrect date and time, automatic closing of the application, which was recently added, practically made WhatsApp useless for me. plz fix it or return to the past version"
4,"Suggestion: 01. There must be separate tab for broadcast lists, groups, and personal chat instead of only chat tab. 02. There must be more pins instead of only 3 pins. 03. There must be a folder where we can save personal documents which are recieved in different chats and groups. 04. Only Name must be shown when seeing the profile of a person. hopefully you will consider my review. Thank You."
2,"Please make option to turn ON BACKUP WHILE IN ROAMING!!!!!! Let me choose do I want to do update or not. Many of us in EU now have almost unlimited internet in EU and I do not like connecting to strange and unknown wi-fi, I rather keep my internet data only on, but I can't go back up for days and weeks while I'm in romaing. PLEASE MAKE IT work, so that I can do or not do backup while in romaing! Thank you"
1,this is the worst thing happening with me using WhatsApp. Every time I remove two step verification and it's logs me out and asks me for two step verification pin. I don't know what to enter when I have not set any pin. I have turned off that pin
1,The update is not bad but it keeps stopping and kicks me out of the app. Been struggling for the past few hours but unable to use it. It's a big problem seeing that this is my main way of communicating
1,This new updated version of whatsapp is just making my typing slow. Emojies sometimes freeze and texts fly away...it is as if it's glitching. I wish I did not update it. Please fix this.
5,"Whasap is an app that l enjoy so much. Thanks to the development team for this App. I thought that there is this new feature that allows one to exit a group without the group members knowing, but unfortunately , l still see when people leave a group and l am not an Admin in those groups. Thanks team whasap , continue the good work. God bless you."
5,"WhatsApp is the best and most useful app I have seen. It connected millions of people who miss each other, for an affordable price for all. Thank you very much WhatsApp for service to humanity. It is the best example for a true app which serves its purpose properly"
5,"I was just thinking, what If I wasn't have WhatsApp.??? How can I will interact with my friends and family. And how can I communicate to the world easily and efficiently. And also WhatsApp help me in my study purposes, specially for file sharing and to concept clear from teacher or classmates through voice note. Thanks WhatsApp and entire team for this amazing application."
3,App was great until the emoji layout update. Everything is mixed up on the emoji and gif menu and when you try to send emojis or gifs it pops over the current message your busy typing. Which means you have to swipe the menu and chat up and down every single time you try to send an emojie with your message.
1,"Calls don't ring on Android 12! Blocked contacts still show up in chat. Need a white list black list method, ever thought maybe you just want to talk to one or a few people and not let everyone in your contacts know you have whatsapp? Ever thought about that? It's called privacy."
2,"Hello, i have a problem with video call, i still can do video call but when i open my camera or instagram's camera while video calling, its turn off my camera by itself and can't press the camera icon on video call options, it's become calling not video calling, it's a bug, i am using android 9. And when i sending picture or file while video calling, the video call closed by itself. Please fix it. Thanks."
2,The previous settings for emoji dialogue box was the best mode.... This is very slow and changing it's history character after opening the emoji box..... It takes time....just wastage of time.... Please fix this as fast as possible...i really love WhatsApp.....but this was not expected by me.... please fix.....
4,"After new update I can't see my new updates directly, i have to go through all previous updates and can't delete previous updates or new one by selecting them all at once , i have to delete one by one . It was better before updating this app but after new update it got worse So, i wanted you guys to fix this update. Thank youüòë"
4,"If we delete something in whatsapp, the notification goes to someone else, then we don't want it again, like we also want the notification to go, something like this needs to be an option so that we can do the settings. Anyone who can will completely delete the notification will not go to others or if someone makes the settings so that the notification will come to him then it will come but I want the system to be a little better."
1,Super pathetic app..been logged out for 15 days without any redressal..while logging on the messanger does not even share the code..says you have two step verification and code sent to your email...there is hardly any code at the registered email id including spam folder..been writing several mails and no avail...super pathetic app..their days are over...WhatsApps has gone sick
5,"I love the new features that's been added, especially the edit feature is cool. But please I would love it if you can add hide chat feature whereby if you hide chat no one will be able to see it even the user itself. Like I said earlier I love the feature that's been added, it's great I will love to see more feature if there are upcoming features"
3,"I wish they upgrade their status editing area providing trending music, sounds to put in the status it is realy so old ..other than this all good..video quality decreases when uploading... Needs more upgrade"
4,"Like Snapchat you should be able to have a private status as well as your main status, I'm aware you can exclude people from seeing your status but it would be more convenient if the option of having a private status was a thing."
4,The application is standard. The best i would say. But to make things easier to log in is you could allow the user to use facial scan to make things easier. An update wouldn't hurt. Thanks..‚ù§Ô∏è
5,This app is working great. But I would like to have one feature in to it. When you don't save any in your contacts you can't call from Whatsapp. It's my suggestion that even if the person is not in your contacts you can send them message. Also in group I don't want to show others who are there in the list. In my opinion this feature is not only for me but many who wants their groupies to be safe and secure.
5,"Whatsapp is one of the good messaging platform. I am using it for my University Group Study. But it is now forcing me to by a new mobile phone because of whatsapp no longer work with my version of Android. My country inflation and my economic are very difficult in place. I kindly request to whatsapp, please extend your support. Thanks."
2,The latest update uploads status at very low quality. It's very grainy and noisy. And I dont get notification for calls just ringtone is played.
2,"while using the camera on the app, the images look really sharp and good, but the moment i click the picture (or video) it becomes SOOO SOFT and the color is SOOOOO OFF it is really annoying idk if this is a bug, but this is a really big issue on my phone(s23)"
2,"WhatsApp was perfectly fine till yesterday afternoon. But then, when I'm messaging anyone the message delivered showing just one tick. But, I can't receive any message or call. Even I can't call anyone. Please resolve this issue ASAP. Thankyou!"
2,This latest feature where the search bar in status is off isn't the content we signed up for. It's annoying. Kindly take me back to the old app. You should make it optional tbh
3,"I have been using WhatsApp for years now and think it's great. However, yesterday I appeared to get a new version in respect of how emoji are selected and this is being tested apparently. I did not sign up for testing and don't know why I have this. Driving me mad trying to get help with it!"
1,"I can not get this app working. Been trying for 6 weeks. I have all the requirments, visited my network and to be sure, got a new sim. I send lots of emails to Whatsapp, and still nothing. no sms, and no call"
1,"Hate the new update. Whenever I want to choose an emoji, the screen changes, emojis at the bottom then you have to press send on the middle of the screen basically. Honestly, it's not even convenient that whatsapp made it this way. Please change it back"
4,"I use it and I don't have trouble. I'm in Mexico rn, and it still works. (Even though I'm from the US) it works the same and everything works for me the only problem I have is the fingerprint sensor it tell me to wipe the sensor or try again of fingerprint not recognized witch sucks because I spend like 10 min TO TRY TO UNLOCK IT"
4,"Its an amazing app of course but I have a small cocern. Wouldn't you agree that the status limit of only thirty seconds is too short? It just sort of a bother to have to continuously have to crop videos that are over thirty seconds long. Please consider lengthening it, thank you"
1,When I try to upload a status or any video it compress the video/photo at worse quality even tho the video or photo is lesser than 2-3 mb. WhatsApp can't hold this much resolution? everytime ended up compressing 1080/720p to 140p . Previous updates of WhatsApp was also okeyish just don't ruin the file quality and resolution.
1,"Pathetic and disgusting experience, unable to login for the last over one month, tried to reach them several times but nobody is there to help or respond properly, this is happening again and again, if they are not capable then I have asked them to delete/disable my account so that I may move to some other messaging platform."
5,"It's a great platform. I only wish for a feature that can help group status updates in order of interests and priorities. If this can be done, then the app is perfect and ready for the next decade!"
3,"There a bug in new version.. the letter box jumps high leaving empty space in between the letter box n the keyboard.. its ok at first.. but now, it kinda annoying that its still like that after 1 month+++ please fix this"
3,"The updated emoji keyboard... it just was not a necessary change! It's slow, and the layouts have changed (say goodbye to touch typing for a while!) I do not need to see my recent emojis sliding about to take their place in the hierarchy!"
1,"So many bugs after I updated it, even I can't send some videos to the story and it just keep loading, very bad app!! Please fix it if you wanna get 5 stars"
1,"I was very disappointed with the Status feature in WhatsApp. As a businessman, I expected this app to help me communicate quickly, precisely, and efficiently. However, the Status feature actually interferes with my productivity. One of the main problems I encountered was that when I clicked on someone's photo, it showed me their status instead of contact information or the option to call. This really annoyed me and wasted valuable time. I don't need this feature in the context of my work."
4,"Suggestion: right now group and normal chat all in one, which is annoying or messy. possible improvement on top, instead chats/status/calls.. make 4 options chat/group/status/call.. where group shows groups and its messages. Or any other solution from whatsapp is welcome. Thank you"
3,"I love this app. I can keep in touch with everyone from all over. I would love the app even more if you could pin more than 3 chats. Thay way I can keep all the important chats right at the top, hence the 3 stars"
5,Overall it's great and best way to connect the family but I am experiencing a bug for many days..everytime I want to share videos or photos it displays that this file format is not supported even other friends and member can send me the same video but I can't...please fix it as soon as you can..I tried a lot and also googled how to fix it and did everything but it didn't work
4,"Hey! The new update regarding ""initiate a voice chat"" is totally useless and annoying. We have different course related groups and everyone keeps calling mistakenly. Kindly add an option to disable it or If there's any then update me as soon as possible."
5,"I have noticed that the new update with the Emoji layout is not working properly, sometimes it comes with the animations as intended sometimes it has glitches making the chat on top disappear, the idea is great but not just well executed, I hope this is resolved.."
1,Why everytime you mess with emoji settings........always mess with muscle memory buttons......just shuffled everything here to there and announced as new update such updates are so much annoying and disturbed every single button..... if you want to make changes then fix those bugs not all this things that no any advantage.... correct every thing as it is
4,"Great app. Everything's great. Here's where we have a problem, the images. It's 2023, we have cellphones which are capable of taking 200mp shots. Why do you compress the image size? Leave it on HD and everybody's gonna happy ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
1,"Awful experience, my account has hacked severally by an unknown personality; presently have been blocked from using whatsApp which i found very unpleasant; i did nothing wrong, so i don't know why i was blocked. I need my account back as matter of urgency. Thanks."
5,"Thumbs up for the new version,i like the addition of video recording but i so wish you could upgrade it more and make it limitless like like voice notes because video recording only allows us to record for 59seconds,if we could record for the duration we want it would be superb"
1,bad experience with this rubbish app when I tried to backup my data it couldn't find it even I already made a backup with google drive when I login again it shows countdown again and again. I mailed on WhatsApp but they doesn't reply and can't able to solve our problem.üò†üò†üò°üò°
1,The worst thing WhatsApp could do was the channel update. I am a student preparing for my competative exams so I left all social media accounts but this feature feel like that same thing invading my personal space . It's really irritating to see those unknown faces to pop on my WhatsApp . Pls don't try to make WhatsApp alike other social media apps . Do change the update!!!
1,"After new update, the status which were mute are not visible and also removed search options. Search option is good as people's are having multiple contacts, it bad idea to remove search option."
1,Too hard to transfer WhatsApp to another operating system (iOS to android) and keep chat history. Online chat form also not working to ask for assistance. It would be so much easier if WhatsApp was more like Facebook messenger where you can sign in from any device and have all your chats available.
5,This app is so you can even set it to use less DATA when on calls. I love this app highly recommended!!! It's with catching up with your friends and family and especially since it has a chat lock and video message feature I absolutely LOVE ITT!!!!
1,"Very bad updated , only follow channels, we can't see status of our saved contact. Only channels advertisement and follow them. It's personal account not for following someone. -ve 5 rating"
3,"Have a amber tick for viewed but not read for ignored messages. Enable third party backup in any OS which can be Google, apple, Dropbox or even local NAS. Restricting it only to apple/Google in iOS/Android is inconvininent and does not help when a transfer is needed into a different OS phone without source device. Please add telegram like old message archive for new groups joinees. Allow business messages a delete action on notification bar"
1,"what is this new problem with whatsapp, why only people in india is facing such problem of OTP not received from whatsapp, and they cannot reinstall their whatsapp again and use it, if there is any issue with your servers then resolve it, and let them use it again, and if u cannot help then, they will move to some other platform like telegram, which is more secure, this is a common problem nowadays in india which the citizens are facing, from your whatsapp company. And you dont help anyone."
5,"Great app but there's a bug, when you want to upload a video in your status the audio doesn't sync with the video thus when the clip finishes playing, we don't hear the full audio."
3,"I mute the notifications of WhatsApp on the phone setting (SAMSUNG galaxy S9+ Android 11). Unfortunately, this hide the voice call screen but still hearing the ring tone. I have to open the WhatsApp to see the calling badge then the calling screen. I hope you update the app so the voice calling screen still appear even when the notifications of WhatsApp is muted. Thank you a lot. PS: I try the help center and the AI did not recognize this."
1,"1. Let old chats/ conversations upload easily, your process of uploading old chat in the case one loses or changes one's phone is too lengthy, and additionally, it's not everyone that uses Google Drive, learn from Telegram. 2. Let there be in-app language translation such that I can easily translate what another person sends to me in-app. 3. Make it possible to send messages to numbers even without saving it in the phonebook."
2,"App isn't working, keeps saying no connection which isn't the case. All of sudden today nobody's whatsapp is working...Constantly reconnecting in the past couple months.. super annoying...updated 7/12/23 ...Getting worse by the day, you can't go 2 mins without the call saying poor quality in the spot you Cleary have service at...smh 8/14/23"
2,"In what's app, a whole video could be uploaded in parts before. Now the part after 30 seconds of any video can't be uploaded anymore. This problem has been going on for several months.Disgusting.. Fix it soon."
4,I am using this so long time it's nice but there is one suggestion for your team make one pattern security system and and give some more features like add music in pic and filter üòú.but it's so nice app Thank you üôèüèªüòä
1,Newest update is very annoying . . It doesn't show the exact time when status were posted . . Only shows yesterday States panel doesn't have search icon to search for specific contacts And stickers/emojis new menu is very unpractical
2,"Pretty much something different for today. After I woke up and opened my phone to play something, my phone keep telling me that my WhatsApp had stopped working, even if I haven't opened it it still crashed somehow. And now when I opened it, it crashed."
5,"Hello Meta team, I laud the whole META community for their awesome work on the app so far, I can't stop loving it. I have just one suggestion for the team to update into the app. Just like on Facebook, where you have the log in or log out button from your account, I was thinking ü§î if that feature of login in and out could be added to WhatsApp also, it would wow the whole world about the newest feature ever. I hope this my idea can be made possible. Congratulations to the whole community & team."
1,Wow this app has just destroyed its look. The new emoji panel makes the page jump and your tx jump to the top of the page. Having to keep looking to see what u have put instead of it being in eye line. If its not broke dont fix it.
1,Great but the emoji selection UI is weird since the last update. Can you please revert to the previous version? It was much more intuitive and easy to use and not as disruptive.
3,13.08.2023: The emoji input box was changed and I'm NOT okay with it. It takes too long to open and since the deleting the last message got put up there I always switch emoji categories instead. No need to make that many changes. Keep the emoji thing the way it was PLEASE.
2,"Emoji Keyboard Update July 2023 The new keyboard gives you an unnecessary step more when picking out emojis since you have to resize it after every message/sticker or when you go back to the normal keyboard. Which means everything runs less smooth... @WhatsApp, please keep the old one or at least make the default height of the emoji tabs the same as the normal keyboard"
1,"My WhatsApp account has been closed without any reason since last week and I am unable to login with my mobile number i.e. XXXXX XXXXX. When I'm trying to login with a different Phone number WhatsApp is sending OTP to that number but in case of the above mentioned mobile number an error message is showing up. Please refer to the screenshot I have attached to the mail.  I had to face similar situation previously for 2/3 times, but it was corrected and I got message of apologize from WhatsApp."
4,"WhatsApp is simply fantastic. However, it should permit copy of documents directly to the laptop. WhatsApp should have a switch to be put on - like Google. It's a waster of data for now, as it comes on at will once data is on! Thanks. Engr. U"
5,"Since begining it was simple,effective,later many features added but netwrk poor,but somehow it worked,slow though.Overall, it gave results,@ least from our Media point of view,& personal experience all over India & our families abroad brought us closer.I would give 8 on 10.Keep it up,but added apps operations has to b properly explained,may b some stores should hv sections for new/added apps personal operational properly explained.This is for btr/smooth operations.nt good pl.."
4,The only thing that I beleive is missing is a separate list or section for managing multiple groups that are scattered all over the chat list. It makes it more organized and structured as well.
1,Too many updates and app still does the same thing. Stop updating to higher memory storage and selling personal information gathered from our contact lists...text messages....photo albums...and recording what we talk about.
3,"The auto rotate of the video call should be according to user, there should be given ON/OFF option. And one more issue which must be fixed - While being on video call, the icon or the video of the caller screen remains at a fixed place just right side below after minimising the screen which is really annoying."
3,"Although this app is running well..but when it comes to put any video on status...There comes the main problem...it pops up with the message that ""Can't upload the video,please choose a different file"" Do something..."
1,Very upset with recent updates everything is fine but if you want to see or delete yours recent status you have to go throw all earlier status to reach the last one and it is very hectic to do this all think who use to update status on bunch so please do something about this earlier there is option in status to see all things in 1 line it is very convenient to use thanks
1,"I'm intensely unhappy about the new keyboard layout in WhatsApp - alignment, layout, placement, everything has been tampered with. Kindly do something about it, or don't - users are as good as a product. Why listen to the users? I'm baffled actually, why change something when it's already doing a good job? Is this the way to earn your coveted promotions?"
1,"WhatsApp owner Facebook/Meta loves misinformation and hates scientific, fact-based challenges to that misinformation. That is the only conclusion I can arrive at when I look at Facebook's history of censorship over the past 3+ years on COVID, climate change, and many other topics. Its ""fact checkers"" are aligned with Big Government. Problem is, the government narrative on the lab leak, lockdowns, masking, the 100% efficacy of vaccines, and many other issues is not aligned with the truth."
2,Shout out to the UX/Dev that made the draw over image feature you failed big time. It's 2023 and we still can't select part of text within a message. Seriously what's is going on with UX and developers these days. Fix up WhatsApp give us good features.
2,"WhatsApp I'm trying my best to stay calm in this review, please fix the issue that you clearly created with the extremely low quality status updates. I can confidently say that this issue was created by your incompetent developers because my phone was able to upload HD 12MB videos on my status, but after a update back in May... You guys have completely tanked the quality. I've kept quiet hoping you guys could fix this issue but to no avail. Kindly please read, reply and fix. Will update review."
1,Separate status and channels so they can be their own individual tabs The changes to the status tab is too much and some key features like the fact that the search bar and the more icon besides my status that lets me skip to which ever status I want no longer exist
3,"Please please make it so that media files are stored in the app like in Messenger and you choose if you want to save them to your gallery. This is such a nuisance if you use whatsapp for work or have groups with a lot of people, if you want to see a piece of media you have to download it. My gallery is so full of random stuff because of this"
5,"Asking for the end-to-end encryption password which I never created, and when trying to create a new one it wouldn't let me do that. Due to this all my chats are gone and now the help center is also just useless I used to keep my chats and data backup on google drive account but still not able to get all my chats back WhatsApp need to look into this just wasted all my important data and time"
5,"Whatsapp has been such a great app, but it will be fun if you can allow us to share movies or download movies via WhatsApp just like telegram, and also increase your picture quality, Whatsapp do reduce picture quality when posted, it's sometimes blurry, which is very bad, also increase Whatsapp video and audio call quality, thanks."
4,"I impressed about last update on archive chats. Provide one more option, in main menu for archive chats, like status. One small suggestion from my side, better to add after chat and before status. By providing this update, it should must useful to avoid unwanted chats üòï, when am opend my WhatsApp, their is lots of junk, am not able to find out which one is imp, especially it's covering my personal chats means what ever imp."
5,"Dear WhatsApp Team, I am writing to request a new feature for WhatsApp status. Currently, when we upload videos to our status, the quality of the video is reduced. I would like to request that you add a new option to allow us to choose the quality of our status videos. For example, we could choose between ""Normal Quality,"" ""Medium Quality,"" and ""Original Video Quality."" I believe that this would be a popular feature with many users."
1,"I am using official whatsapp donloaded from play store but after the latest update released on 17th July 2023, I get an error stating, ""You need to use the official Whatsapp to use this account"". I get redirected to this page on play store. After I reinstalled the app, I got the same error. Just because Whatsapp is not getting installed, do I now need to change my phone? Please resolve this!!"
1,"My experience with whatsapp is very good. However, lately, with the new updates, the format of the emojis, GIFs, qnd stickers became really bad. I hope that this issue will be fixed soon Thank you"
1,Video calls can be recorded by screen recorder and screenshots are easily taken. let's talk about privacy and srcurity. Signal messenger takes care of this issue very well. Atleasr copy that feature so that video calls are more secure and also no one takes screenshots.
5,Why does media upload quality reduce for samsung users? It breaks my heart every time I made a quality time and want to upload it becomes very blurry and low in quality. So far WhatsApp is the most used app in the world and Nigeria in particular many use it for different purposes. But the issue if this upload quality should be resolved for android users pls. .....................................Thankyou..............................................................................................
3,Would have given it a five star perfect but i think they should implement the feature that doesn't let archive chats see when you're online or see a second tick. And also people that i block should not be able to see the message box to send any messages üòä
1,"The app is good and great but the latest update made my posts not to go successful, If I send videos to someone or post a video on my status it won't go through it will continue loading non stop. at first I thought it was my data and I subbed again and it's still doing the same thing please you people should do something about this because as I am now am not happy with it."
3,"Doesn't matter how good your picture quality is, every time you upload it in the WhatsApp status, it will always scale down the quality. From sharp to a little bit of blurry images."
1,"It deserves 5 stars. But suddenly my contact name are missing in whatsapp. Instead of displaying contact name, only contact number are showing. It is hard to find people in whatsapp. Please fix it, then I will change my rating."
5,So far so good üëçüëçüëç and recommend to use it Just my opinion. Could you change space for call & video call to left side because my experience especially whatsapp group some people touch it without their unnotice. So far myself still very carefull to use setting button (group). Thank you
1,At start whatsapp was working well but when I joined 50 groups after that it slow down and now the situation is that when i open it always show initializing and takes 5 minutes to open and almost 30 minutes to send and recieve messages and files. Also I have to forward message then it take one hour to forward it. Kindly improve whatsapp otherwise this issue will be faced by other users and in the end they will uninstall whatspp and go to better app than this.Thank you
4,"Great app, only problem is picture and video compression but mostly great! Can keep in touch with family and friends and make your own stickers and use stickers this app lets you personalize it to your liking."
1,"Awful app. Awful Facebook. Don't want every Tom dick and Harry knowing everything about me. Have started using signal and telegram and much better apps. Do yourself a favour and ditch anything to do with Facebook. They ruin everything. Links for Instagram only open on their web page now. Then I get bombarded with download the app, open in the app messages. None of which works. Can't even send scheduled messages. What's the point of this app?"
2,"Been forced to use this app for school and work. One day it stopped and said ""problem with Whatsapp reinstall the app again"" which I did multiple times and from different angles, solutions in the official psge doesn't help (such as cleaning cache and making enough space for the app, 20 gbs of space must no be enough, reinstalling snd restarting the divice, etc , etc.)"
3,"No way to define time to send message... My android SMS app can do it üôÑ If I am, for example, on vacation and find an interesting article, and want to sent to co-workers, I'd love to not disturb their vacations, but still send the link over before I forget about it."
5,"I am much more secured at WhatsApp messenger but i want to some extra feature in my WhatsApp to save my precious time . 1.""I would like an additional feature in WhatsApp that allows me to view status updates only from specific contacts I select. It would be helpful if this feature could also send me notifications when they update their status."""
2,"Please remove the channel in your new update apps. Also, in the previous version, you can off read receipts and view the status so that you can hide your name from the viewed list. But this new update it won't happen anymore. So please bring back these features."
1,"the "" transfer chat using qr code"" feature is just broken. After transferring, it returned back to previous screen then it crashed. Then trying to restore using google backup also causing it to crash and my bckup was gone. Thanks..now my chat is no more."
2,"In this new latest update, Is it just me or we all facing the problem of not having 'search' button to search for certain people's status? Previously whatsapp have that features. I want it back for me to easy searching my friends updated status without having to scroll till the bottom of the status' lists"
3,"Very satisfied with the chat lock option within the app now, but it is not working showing something went wrong even after checking connections and other problems this is very irritating. Please fix this error. all over the app is very good excellent service. THANK YOU"
1,"I really hate that I can't add a full-sized picture on my profile. And, it really sucks that I can only select a certain part of a picture that I want to use for my profile. Meta if you fix this, you instantly get a 5 star rating."
5,"I would not recommend WhatsApp to be used for businesses. However it is very helpful for individual usage. It delivers quick, timely, functional, and consistent communication between any two individuals over half decent Wi-Fi. It has its kinks to it, like kicking you off once you start running low on storage, or automatically downloading the photos of friends when you forgot to unselect that option. But over all it is a great program to use! I am very satisfied whatsapp messenger"
1,"I dnt know what's wrong with whatsapp. I can't make voice calls or video calls. My messages don't send through most times even when I have data. As a matter of fact, my whatsapp has become unreliable and its frustratingly annoying. Pls Whatsapp treat this matter urgently"
5,"Please please, add a option in status that we can upload high quality video, and this not my personal review even my friends and family face this issue, they and I, we are not satisfied the status video quality, all in all WhatsApp experience was very good not doubt believe me, however you must have to add some options that we can upload high quality video on what's app status, because people what's to see high resolution video. That you for everything sir/ Ma'am. I love what's app ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíï"
1,"I've not been able to login to my account for days now. Every time I put in my number to log in a message will appear on my phone that I should use the official whatsApp app to log in. When I then tap on the link to take me to official WhatsApp page, it brings me to play Store to download or update. When I'm done updating or re-downloading then try to log in, it still repeat the same message, so I don't know what could possibly go wrong with the app, both the whatsApp messenger and Business"
1,"Every single new update keeps ruining the app you need to stop, the videos you upload are of low quality and the feature of changing quality is removed... Again the channels are not worth it.. The other thing is the new positioning of the emojis to be honest I don't like these new updatesüò™üíî"
4,"This app is the best reliable app ever, it enable you to download and rate your favourite app,and it also help download easy, faster and efficient app that perform a specific and durable task. It also present a profile picture that best explain that appropriate task your app will perform, so please draw near to Google Play Store and see durable and affordable app with no taxes"
5,Great app ever. Big suggestions. -Make Whatsapp send message to other social media. -Add inbuilt status saver - Enable saving of personal avatar Profile photo. -Enable messages & media to save in WhatsApp database storage without needs for several backups and let Whatsapp maintains original quality of photos. Thanks for your services.
1,"**SCAMMERS ARE USING THIS APP** a scammer will call you and say they from your work and ask you to read a code to you that ""they sent"" but this code they want is access to your device and still your info, this has happened to a number of people I know and they just tried to do it to me! Can't see anyway to contact WhatsApp to get answers to why they need so much access to our device and scammers can take it all in seconds? Never give out any codes that popup on the screen!"
1,"The first number I am using, I was forced to stop using it, due to just suddenly it stop working it keep on showing me that I have to put two steps verification code, which I have never once put any code before, so I leave that account, registered with another number, I start sending messages to my friends that, I am no more longer using that account, introducing my new account, suddenly this new account has been banned, I don't no why"
5,I use WhatsApp to communicate with my boyfriend who is overseas. It never seems to disappoint. We are able to talk on the apps too. I long for the day we are able to talk face to face yet this app works quite well in the meantime.
2,"Updated: 07/17/23 I hope WhatsApp has more privacy protection for its subscribers. I received lots of messages from an unknown sender and business number. I hope there is maybe a ln option to restrict who can search and contact you, like what Skype has. Also, suggest having more functions where users can hide their registered mobile numbers. Also, I suggest that instead of reading the receipt blue check, head icons would be great like what fb messenger has."
4,It's a nice Messenger app as compared to others in the market sometimes it's works slow but normally it's works fast. But I have one problem using this app is when I sent an image or video their quality gets down but in other app it doesn't happen I am waiting for new features of this app and must want WhatsApp will do better job in their quality sharing
4,"Been using it for about 10 years now and I'm not disappointed, but it still misses the option to set a timer after which messages get deleted from both sides or deleting messages backwards for each party once it's already been read, like Telegram already has"
2,"There are some bugs in new update... When I react on message, chat message box disappears every time... 2nd some time chat message box shift on top and message also shift respectively... This is very annoying... Fix this as soon as possible"
1,"Of course WA is great to use... if you can actually get to use it. My previous phone's screen died. So when I tried to migrate my account to the new phone, WA sent a verification code to my previous phone. You can see my problem... Then, when I try to contact support, it keeps giving me stupid options, of which none cover my issue and that seems to be the end of the line. I can't get a message sent, because the next step is to send a screenshot when the problem is not on the new phone! Idiotic!"
1,"Latest update is a step back. Horrible experience to use the app now. When you use emoji the chat disappears, half of the screen becomes empty etc. Total chaos. Something went really wrong this time."
1,Facing difficulties during voice and video call. It always tells that connecting and after that call disconnects. Solve this as soon as possible.
5,The app is functioning beautifully well. My challenge is that I can't highlight text and copy to another app. or save my documents. There is indeed great improvement.
3,"Perfectly fine! Except that I CANNOT USE ANY FILTERS on a status. It pulls up only half way, and when I attempt to select a filter after rebooting it still selects the status viewer options instead. Extremely annoying as I have to edit photos independently before posting! I know it couldn't be my device as it is a fairly new one. I wish the WhatsApp bundle would accommodate for voice/video calls too. That's between developer & network providers I guess."
4,Gets the job done. Checks all the marks functionality-wise but could really use some TLC with regard to UI; it's starting to look old and dull.
2,"When I'm in a video call or normal call on whatsapp, I can't watch a video on all the browsers, it'll load the video on browser but it won't play, if u unpause the video it'll just play one frame and pauze again, i tired everything and didn't work so whatsapp is the problem, pls fix this"
5,"Its awsome updates for communication. And i have a request,if somebody read our mesage it should show the sender that its read even there is blue tick or not, and if the receiver doesn't like to read then the message shouldn't shown to him , becouse its not a postal 19th century period, to wait someone to reply to know that the message is delivered and read.. Its an equal right to know the read status. And its the right to choose to see then read. Hope you people will consider this."
2,"Will not download videos. Tried all the recommended fixes, none works. Reset mobile, bluetooth, airplane mode and Uninstalled reboot reinstalled. Still will not download and open vodeo files. Picture and YouTube videos work fine."
3,"The new UI change for the emoji, gif, stickers bar is not good. It's harder to navigate and the stickers are taking more time to load, the old UI was better. Reverting this change would be best."
4,"You can find no critism with this as after all you just use data to use it. When you can send pictures and other media for free. Hold fire, so why not 5 stars. On a couple of Occasions I have received messages from sources not on my contacts list. I expect this with FB messenger but not with WhatsApp & it never used to happen."
3,"It is the only popular app that do not show ads and no premium in this app, this is the best messaging app across the world. It is milllion times better than Snapchat and Instagram. It is most secure app for private chat but, 1st problem- I have request to app developer to block the screenshot of chat in next update. Because my Girlfriend leaked my chat to her friend. 2nd problem- Others do not like to show deleted messages, then you can make deleted messages like telegram."
1,"I hate this new version, I don't know what you guys did but ever since I updated my WhatsApp, it has been hanging and been freezing all by itself üíî I even don't like the way Emojis poops up now, it's just too annoying and frustrating. Please try fixing this issueüòí"
3,"Media upload quality - missing? I'm using WhatsApp version 2.23.16.76 but unable to find ""Media upload quality"" in settings. Is that removed in installed version? If not, pls help me locate that setting. Thank you!"
4,"It's a really better version. If only corrections could be made on the duration it takes when trying to share a message, it takes a lot of time to load contact"
1,"The new update is the worst. Please fix it I hate how they've set up the new emoji window. Older one was better. You can't even see half the texts you type and the emojis you use. If you're on a new line, say in a big text message, the bottom part is not visible at all. Fix immediately"
3,All other features are good and satisfying but then new emoji and sticker tray UI is very awkward and unsatisfactory. It also make it difficult to use sticker and emoji. The team is requested to roll back to old emoji tray.
5,"Not much to complain about the app. But we see that the call history does not update right away, and we are still not able to make colored texts without going through apps."
5,"Was very satisfied by the service it was very, flexible, user friendly and not having many unceasary questions. And after all I believe it was very secured as my person security questions were asked before access to my about was given. There for I rate this with a 5 star rating, on flexibility, security and efficiency."
1,"After updating, WhatsApp contact list taking too much time in loading. Also when we forward any message it takes atleast 60-90 second just to load the list. Also tried by clearing cache but still not work."
1,"Unable to back up my data, me trying to back up more than 1 hour for 200mb. I have more than 2GB but unable to back up fully 100%, now 99% completed more than 5 minutes but not 100% completed. Worst application nowadays (years)"
2,"Really really dislike the new sticker/ emoji tray. It jumps to a different section, so you have to scroll back to where you were, e.g. regularly used stickers. The emoji section also jumps meaning you can't see your whole typed message. Very very annoying."
2,I can't even access my account... I don't know what's wrong with the app but ever time I try to sign in to my account I keep getting blocked out... This issue has to be fixed ASAP... I love What's app.. it kills me to give it a two star but this issue has to be fixed....
2,"The older version was good compared to this new update.. Emoji section gif's sections are moved up, and the smileys usage has become slow.. Bring back the old one wr everything was correct in its place and operation was way too fast .. This is slow totally.. And yes I have plenty of space in my phn so dont give suggstions of clearing cache or memory etc.."
1,The recent update has made my WhatsApp experience very bad. Whenever you go to add emogi that experience is very bad. I like the previous version where we can easily input emogi without switching effects and emoji sliding effect.
4,"Whatsapp is enough build for daily routine but the features like scheduling is not in WhatsApp yet is very disappointed. People are so much busy in there routine life and this days everyone is connected through the social media for prompt responses, scheduling can help to avoid missing the msg delivering delay or accuracy. Whatsapp devlopment team has to think on it, this not a big challange or task for them."
1,"The app just chooses to sign out the user without any actual argument. When wanted to restore it, it stsrted prepairing for restore for 3 hours. Afterthat it just started crashing, and is ever since. App is not useful anymore"
3,"I was loving it until today. I can't receive video calls or more precisely, I answer a call and nothing happens. The same when I try to video call someone, they answer SMS the call doesn't get connected."
1,"Whatsapp is now working very baad too much hanging , bugs . Slow down speed not forward messages quickly have to wait 1 to minutes. Going bad and bad every day. If you don't solve these issues people will start to join another alternatives apps . It will be great loss for you"
4,"I am happy with watsapp butI would like to suggest an additional feature to be added, that is to select and see the postings of a person in a group..Read reciept option is individually required for status and chats..Otherwise everything is fine.."
1,The new update really ruined the status updates menu. U cant delete a specific status without actually opening ur status and you cant watch a specific status u sent without scrolling through ur status. Me and my friends really hate the new status revamp and it is so messy now. Please bring back the old status.
3,"This is a good app for talking with my relatives, who live across the Atlantic, but I am constantly being messaged by people at all hours of the night, spam calls that crash whatever apps I am currently using, and blocking/reporting these people does nothing. One such person has been calling me ""Patricia"", and has messaged me on no less than 8 different accounts, even though I have reported them all. In conclusion, the app works fine, but you will be spammed"
1,In WhatsApp application their is a defect in status. Whenever we are posting any videos or photos it's resolution become very low. It should be in original quality or high quality.
1,"The sticker tray update sucks !!! it makes me dizzy because when you select a sticker folder, it scrolls aaaall the way through all your other folders. bring back the old sticker tray! It was working perfectly fine"
3,The app is ok but sometimes the voice note just freezes and I can't make voice notes for like hours. I don't know why it's doing this but I would like it fixed . So far so good but I would like this issue fixed
1,Due to the change in version now that we can't update or use the app please look at it.. Because as a result we are missing on our important chats and updates. My daughter's school group has all the important messages but she is missing on it.... Please do something... We have lots of expectations from WhatsApp
5,"The Emoji panel isn't coming coming up completely, I updated mine just this morning and suddenly, the emoji panel is shorter than it normally is... I have to exit that chat, come back in and click the emoji panel button so that it'd return back to normal. PLEASE FIX. Edit - Nice work on fixing the bug you guysüëåüèæüëçüèæ"
5,"I really like this app, I wonder if there was a function to mark a message urgent or be able to nudge someone. Or even important where the app then reminds the receiver or a notification every 5 or 10 mins until its been read."
2,"My app was totally fine until yesterday morning, it asked me to verify my number claiming it might have been registered on another phone, i tried but couldn't receive the verification code. I have installed and uninstalled several times but it keeps me on hold for an hour still nothing changes. How can you help me please"
3,"I am facing the backup issue with latest update of whatsapp before that everything works fine. But now backup stuck on some percentage and not going ahead. I have tried all method of fix this clearing cache data, restarting phone. Even new fresh back it still don't working."
5,"Excellent, pls give a solution to backup my account. It's only 3 Gb data, while backuping showing 5 Gb. One suggestion is to add the feature that the receive a delivery message with time of the successful delivery."
1,Even of it's a useful app it's photo and video sent to others looses it's quality drastically. And the worst part is no matter how high quality pictures or videos you upload it will be of no use because the quality always looses.
1,Time to fire all ui/ux people. With every update the ugly animations are added to parts ui. This is making app unusable. Previously I could just click whereve I wanted now I need your fancy animation to finish before interacting with ui. Especially popup on top right of is so flawed. The sticker popup is unacceptably slow.
1,"WhatsApp support is so bad. I have a problem getting the verification number when using apps such as ""mobile transfer"" to transfer my data between my old iphone to my new android phone. I have been contacting WhatsApp support. Everytime they responded the same thing (auto-reply). No one us helping me resolve the problem for five days today. This is so frustrating."
2,"What have you done with the new update? Completely ruined the smiley screen and it is glitchy. Does not open up and cannot maximize that screen. Even when it does, all you see is 1.5cms of that screen. I thought updates were supposed to improve on the previous versions!"
1,The newest update is below average. It has negatively impacted my experience. Archived messages keep showing up as normal messages and the Pp just seems upside down. I wish could revert to the previous state
2,"I hate that my contact's status can be opened from 'Chat' menu through their profile picture. That's my quick access for contact's info and I don't really care about status, so that update is useless and just annoying. If you need some ideas for the next update, then make chat editable (and add 'edited' label and its collapsible history), or add option to select all chat/call at once, or let us have better quality for pictures/videos and add 'save data' option for those with slow connection."
1,"To The Managers of Whatsapp Support Platform. Please could you kindly help out with few relevant options on the usage of your official Whatsapp, I think from my own point of view, if you are able to do that, and I'm also able to apply them appropriately, I believe that at that point, your management will unblock my line, and thereafter, I will be able to communicate with my business colleagues effectively. Thank you, and remain blessed."
1,"I just updated my WhatsApp 3 days ago and I'm regretting it already. The glitches in this update is terrible, I can't forward a message, I can't turn off the read receipts without my status viewers disappearing, almost zero privacy and is time WhatsApp enable edit message to their update. My friends who use other version of WhatsApp are really testifying about their great features. Pls make this app enjoyable for everyone. Thank you."
2,The pin I created when I set up 2- step verification code.has been compromised and I could not access my whatsapp page any more. I requested for a direct call for the one time verification pin whatsapp official turned it down and I waited for one hour as instructed for a text message through my e-mail but to no avail. How else could I reclaim my whatsapp account from HACKER(s) now that they have taken over.
1,"I love Whatsapp before Updates but this new features is so messy. Please put Status and Channel in two different tab, revert back Status view in Vertical line (not in Horizontal view like now), allow user to select and view each of their own status (not by viewing it from the beginning)and allow user to search by friend's name. Quite upset but thank you for the previous Whatsapp release!"
5,"I am really enjoying everything about WhatsApp. Kudos to you and please can you give option of editing to a sent message for further correction??? Thanks Can you please add an option of editing chat after sending??? Thanks. And also, can you give option of recording WhatsApp calls?"
2,"please fix the upload status section, the uploaded status sometimes looks bad, or has a bad resolution, I've turned off the data saver to the best quality, but strangely the resolution doesn't change at all and becomes a very strange video"
4,"This is the best communication app you can text or call anyone around the world. But there us a problem like yesterday I sended 1 video of 2mins to someone it tooked the whole day but at night it was successfully sended then the person called me and told the video you send is not playing saying "" this is not in your file say the user to send again """
1,"There's no way to block messages from numbers that are not in Contacts. I keep getting scam messages from overseas, mainly Bangladesh and India. And I have to block them individually because the app doesn't have an option to do it automatically."
1,"Whoever thought of this update that when we upload or download a video, the notification sound keeps on beeping. Which genius thought of this idea.?? Really such an annoying update especially when the app backups at midnight, wakes me up from deepsleep. So so soooooooo annoying that it makes me want to break the phone."
2,"Plz, add a ownmobile music files status editz of 2023 on WhatsApp. And Get a incredible update Status editor by musics, videos,texting,etc in any languages. & Set a Photomusics Status in ownfiles audio,and make slow-motion video. So, that. I would like to love it. (Thanks,)"
5,"Recently a lot of updates are being seen in WhatsApp, which can be considered as a very good option, which is a good app that can avoid WhatsApp GB and other third party apps. New features have been added to it, but something else can be possible in it too."
1,The new sticker tray is one of the worst experiences. Think about the scenario where you have 500+ stickers. I would rather swipe three times to get to my sticker pack than wait 7-8 seconds for it to scroll there.
1,"The recent updates suck! 1. Sending videos as documents is frustrating for me now since I can't cancel the process when I need to. You'll have to send the entire video (large size for me) first then delete afterwards. Allow users to cancel sending files. 2. It is taking even longer to send files that usually took seconds before this recent update (April) 3. You can no longer send multiple files like before. I selected more than 10 songs to send but when I pressed send, only one was sent."
3,"Sending large files is slower compared to other apps. It is a messaging app,so sending messages is the primary concern.Unfortunately it is not fast enough."
1,It's been more than 2 days that I am trying to login to whatsapp and not receiving the verification code.This is very much not expected as I even checked with the mobile network service provide and there is no issue with the Sim. I tried all the suggested solutions and nothing is working. Can whatsapp team look into this issue quickly
2,Was fine till the sticker keyboard mess up. The old keyboard was super responsive. This takes a while. Sometimes the keyboard doesn't even show up all the time you tap an emoticon. The old version was a better option.
5,I currently can't archive messages of chat groups or individuals I don't want to see their messages like I did before updating the app. Tried archiving severally to no avail and even had to update the app again just to see if it would work but still same old same old. And each I make a WhatsApp call it takes several seconds before it connects and I could hear the other user's voiceüôÑüòí. Do something about it please it getting tiring and annoying
1,"From a few days ago I am facing a lot of problem, most of all the problem is on voice call is coming . If I am using any other application and at this time someone's WhatsApp voice call comes, then I cannot hear his voice and neither can he hear my voice, so please fix this problem as soon as possible. Thank you üôèüôè"
1,"I made a review previously on how I was logged out of my account because I was supposedly using a moded version of the app. Well I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and it still doesn't let me get my original account, keeps on saying I am using a moded version of the app. Can anyone help me with this? It's been a month."
5,"The app is amazing, however i would like to advice on disappearing messages feature, this is good features but i think it should be one end feature/decided, one should not apply to other end on disappearing messages, which means if i select disappearing messages should only apply to my account not the other side. Should not delete the conversation on other end."
3,"this app is getting better and better every year, but the most two features i need and will make it the ideal chating app is first, store messages on cloud like messenger. second, making calling experience better with video or just regular call, because calling experience is the worst thing in this app"
1,"When I am sending the pdf to the other person it doesn't reach. The rest of the messages get lost. Why is this the only one having the problem? While all the settings are fine, this is happening since the update"
3,"WhatsApp is responding well but I have 2 issues: 1. The app drags as soon as I turn on my data, and takes some seconds before it responds. 2. The WhatsApp status should be upgraded to accommodate large videos instead of the 30 seconds trimming"
2,"I'm writing this review to report that I'm not getting the new Chat Lock feature on my Realme Narzo 50 Pro device. I've updated WhatsApp to the latest version, but the feature still doesn't show up. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but that didn't work either. I'm not sure if this is a problem with my device or with WhatsApp itself, but I'm hoping that the developers will see this review and look into it."
1,"I am very sorry to say that WhatsApp is woefully negligent in providing their services. I have repeatedly told that my account is blocked, they are not responding. I have been sending email after email they are not helping. It is repeatedly said that ""you need the official whatsapp to use this account website "". And again and again I've been doing that but still the same problem ? I have even said that I am an emergency service person and this repeated block of yours is causing my normal work."
3,"Not bad, seems it did some sort of auto update I didn't approve and now the app is all jacked up, stickers and emojis menu is stupid, and the text body has shifted to the very top of the screen not allowing me to see previous messages.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2,"Not liking it no more due to it used to give me the option to convert photos in HD. The feature for HD, I can no longer see on my app when I take a photo? Why is this !?"
4,"The message editing feature is good, but it's difficult to find. It would be better to use an icon in the three-dot menu or display it in a popup instead of showing emoji reactions"
4,"Love the app. The only big issue is that when I transferred to my new phone, it was very hard to get my messages to transfer. But otherwise, it is a great way to communicate with people who don't live in the country. Would definitely recommend it. No adds."
1,"Hi Whatsapp customer service!I cannot get the older conversation and data with my friends and family just like in Facebook messenger.If someone lose their mobile phone they cannot get the older conversation and data. I suggest you to update some features like Facebook messenger,so we could get all the data simply by logging in our phone number or whatsapp account. Wait for your response."
1,"So frustrating, it's just so hard to forward a file or anything to an individual, talk more of sending! ü§¶ It's really hectic, please look into this. Files can't be taking too long to send nau! ü§¶"
2,"Latest update has again made the app vulnerable. When you click on status, the screen lifts up and when you close it Whatsapp Name on the top left gets cut in half then becomes normal after half a second. Such a glitch"
1,Latest update is damaged. All Google Map links doesn't work.!! Also the search feature is buggy. If i write the full exact name of a saved content i cant see it come out in the results. If i right some of its letters. Contact conversations appear. So dumb!! Please fix these issues. Especially the Google map one. It is a death sentence to my work!!
3,WhatsApp creators if your reading this. Please don't change the emoji keyboard. It is fine the way it is and now that it had changed...it makes it SO HARD TO TYPE please just change it back. The truckers option being at the top HORRIBLE and the fact that it doesn't even take u to the favorites stickers is ever worse it makes everything so difficult. Idk why after SOMANY years y'all thought u should change it....but....dont- It's weird and uncomfortable.....But have a nice dayü§≠
3,"Merging everything to Meta was all good until all the apps started to glitch in something or the other. After the new update, you cannot send multiple documented jpg files at once, even if you select the files you want to send the app just takes the last selected file and sends that particular file only. It is irritating me a lot as I use WhatsApp on a regular basis to share photos and videos. I request the developers to fix this bug as soon as possible."
5,"I recommend a button (switch on/off) to ""view only"" what music or video file a contact is listening to or watching respectively. And/or may be allowed to tap on the file to listen or watch."
2,"This app is just overrated. Don't know why people uses this so much. It lack so many features. Just look how many feature Telegram has. Main features whatsapp lack are Cloud Backup, Large File Size, large group member, Quiz option in Polls, Picture Quality turning low resolution. Pure trash. üëéüëé"
4,"I can't do without it at this point, but I have issues with the in chat scrolling, I intend to scroll up to earlier messages and it skips upwards by weeks, months at times, then I have to scroll down all the way slowly to find what I'm looking for, it's disturbing"
4,"This is the perfect chatting app. My only issue is my phone do not have fingerprint, and it does have face recognition but I can't lock my chats. The apps support hadn't been much help either. Context: my phone is an android"
2,"Full of bugs and glitches, inorder to give facility the smoothy working of it is lacking, please give an stable update for the same. Tried on X2, OnePlus 9T, MI 11 but still the lags are same, please note using the very latest version 2.23.15.81"
1,"Keeps blocking you (This number is not allowed to use WhatsApp/Your account has been locked due to spam)for adding People that asked to join the conservancy/fire and safty groups even if you send them a link.(They've given consent along with there names, numbers, addresses and SIGNATURE and wrote they want us to add them on the WhatsApp groups. My previous number is still blocked ü§¨ When asked to review status I received an email-my account has been unblocked but I need to re register‚õî IT WONT‚ùå"
1,My WhatsApp has been closed saying that I need the official app to use the account. It was deleted and reloaded from play store over and over but the situation is unchanged. It also says that my number cannot be varified. This after I have been using WhatsApp for many years. No one seems able to fix the problem.
5,"Perfect app for talking to your friends,family etc but I have one problem. When I try to send a song or video to someone it does not work and it tells me to pick another one when I try another one it still does not work"
5,"Whatsapp is the nicest chat app, the only thing I will like the developers to add is, Pin Messages. Especially in groups, there supposed to be Pin Messages. Because sometimes we may created a poll for voting but due to plenty of chats, that poll will disappear, but by the process of pinning it. People will still keep chatting while the poll is still visible."
1,"All my chats and status update has been disappearing since the last two days, although they gave me an option to restore I tapped on it and nothing worked. Please the problem should be fixed because it is getting out of hand. Thank you"
3,"I've been using WhatsApp for years now. However the latest update doesn't allow me to send /share multiple documents at a time. I've selected several files but only one file is being sent. I hope the team could something about this. It has caused inconvenience to me and perhaps to many other users too. Current device: Samsung Note 20, with the latest update too."
4,This application is very good and I would like to thanks for the message edit option...... But we want the edit option to rectify the mistake which we sent in hurry burry.... But after editing the word 'edited' appearing in sended message is not good please remove it...
5,"So far so good a free app with best features. It helped a lot to socialize and improve the network. It is an essential communication app. Its user-friendly interface, reliable messaging, and wide range of features make staying connected with friends and family effortless. It's secure and supports various media formats. Overall, WhatsApp is a must-have app for seamless communication."
1,"Love the app but starting to get annoyed at all the false notifications due to backup paused or even backup complete. I don't care if the backup is complete, that is what it is meant to do. The dismiss button doesn't work and on lock screen I can't tell the difference between a message and the notification. Please add settings to disable notifications about backup!"
3,"Very good App, used extensively for multiple purpose. The reason to give less rating is due to lack of the feature to schedule the messages. Even the default messages app in Android has the scheduling option."
4,"Overall the app is great. But this recent update is TERRIBLE. With the emojis and keyboard, you now have to scroll up to get emojis, but it just doesn't work and makes the process tedious. Change back to how it was please."
1,They cannot help you to sign up in rouming when you can't receive an sms even you still signed up on a desktop version. An automatic replies in the only support they are providing. The app itself is good in so many ways but support is useless.
1,App freezes every minute. I've not been able to use the app for days now and it's really annoying. Messages don't get delivered until after hours of sending . Please do something about it.
1,"For the love of god, fix the new emoji and stickers tray, it's an absolute nightmare, not to mention the fact that it's all bugged out. (Really appreciate the edit message and screen sharing features though)"
2,It's a bug (error) pretending to be an application! The only reason people are using it is that most people are using it (maybe due to the time of first release) and API for business.Compared to the rival apps like Telegram it has nothing to defend or deliver. They are trying to add some functionalities that the others already have but they do it the bad way and thats primarily is as a result of old and limited idea behind the app and coding system. They may think of start a totally new app.
3,Overall experience was good but in latest updates am facing a problem. Each time i try to record a voice it turns into an error or sometimes turns into a video recording.
1,It was a great app until the app kicked me out of it and said that my number is not allowed to use WhatsApp. I'll edit my review when this issue is cleared. Edit: The issue was resolved and it started again. It has become a regular thing and it is seriously annoying
2,"The app logged me out without me knowing it. I didn't get my history restored. I didn't alter any settings or change anything. Now, once I managed to get the app working again on the phone and the laptop most of the history is gone, or it says ""waiting"" for messages to load and they're not available apparently. Very frustrating to not be given the option to backup before the app updates or logs you out spontaneously."
1,"Whatsapp keeps on crashing after I changed my device, I have tried everything but it continuosly keeps on crashing. Everytime it shows there's a bug try updating the app after the developer has fixed the error. Please help whatsapp team."
5,"The experience has been great however, they should include an option of either allowing or disallowing an unknown person to chat a person up. Some people are walking nuisance."
1,"Yesterday put of nowhere, it closed up saying that I'm not allowed in WhatsApp, I left two reviews, one they say it was an error an apologize, after that, it happened again, when i got it back this time, it was not even connect to the server so i uninstall WhatsApp to see if it was because of that, the same thing appeared again. I didn't do anything and the last 2 times it said ot was an error, i just want my WhatsApp back."
4,"Great App but include the ability to pin several or multiple chats instead of the current three. Also, bring back the ability to share to multiple WhatsApp contacts. Thank you."
3,This new beta keyboard stuff is straight out atrocious. Maybe it's just because I'm not used to it but they should at least have an option to revert to the old one. Please it's makes texting a nightmare!
2,"Ganesh 12/06/23 I had a very good experience of using this application, and it's so useful for the person to have a conversation with the person who is far from us. just one suggestion you must add up the music in the story uploading so the people who wants to add music with photo or a video can be possible caasily. Must do this change and update it soon, people will so happy to use it. Thank you very much. 62,078 people"
3,"I think last updation is not up to mark. You cannot share multiple files to drive or other devices. second if you edit image in WhatsApp now that is not pick your last step of editing, means it don't remember the font colour and font format which i used in last step."
4,"Like the app. Use it on a daily to connect with family and friends. The only downside is that: - there must be a 30day option for disappearing messages, because from 7days to 90days is a far stretch. - the message left after deleting a message should be removed, because what's the point of deleting if it notifies the receiver the message was deleted. Other than that, I have no other problem with the app."
3,"I've been having an issue with the update recently First, the call log takes time to be updated and also I can't forward messages anymore, it takes an eternity to load. This is really annoying, pls do something about it and fix the bug"
1,"Smartest app! (not). It creates backup locally as many as you wany and they remain saved even after uninstall, but when you reinstall it it will restore only the last one from the cloud. RIP logic. RIP devs and smart BAs and managers."
3,There is a screen share feature now but I can't see that icon on my video call to share my screen and I have updated my app. What could be the issue? And guys do you know that there is also a video note feature? üòä WhatsApp is one interesting app! Kudos to the team üëèüèΩ
5,"Hello team WhatsApp developer, I have a suggestion, how about you guys put on top (fixed) the self WhatsApp, I've used this feature since long time ago (started at 2015) as my private note, so it'll be easier to navigate, and please add multiple sub note group within self WhatsApp to allow note management between works, business, hobbies and etc, etc thank you and have a good day"
3,"Everything was going well with this app, but the emoji keyboard on the new update is so bad. Why is it so small? At least let me change it permanently instead of having to extend it each time. And why does the reply to messages not open the keyboard anymore? Not a fan of this new update"
2,"Quite good and exceptional for the past couple of year's. But with the recent updates, glitches has been erupting simultaneously. I can't even see & make use of my edit message feature rn"
5,Good app I have been using whatsapp from very long time and recently I found that there is one common problem which is facing everyone not related to whatsapp its common problem and no social media app have solution of this problem. So I have a solution of this problem and I am sure that if we add this feature will definitely solve this issue and increase our customer sharply i tried to contact whatsapp team but unable to do so please contact me to discuss this feature
5,Whatapp is good but it would be great with some new features. I would suggest these features to be added in WhatsApp: 1) scheduled messages It will be very usefull to send a message at a particular time without forgetting.
4,"The issue I experience that at times I have blurry vision on the screen and I have to keep calling, I also do not like when the pictures in whatup messenger are allow to be view with Facebook, if I did not place the picturesque in Facebook ,then it should not be there.thats it."
1,"My WhatsApp keeps on instantly losing the moment i open it. Tried to clear cache, uninstall and reinstall, restart phone, reset app settings but none of it worked. Can't work from WhatsApp for 2 days in a row now. Kindly fix the issue!"
3,"Please bring back the old Whatsapp. Not this new channels and stuff. We just want a proper, not-too-much data using, instant messaging app. That's it. That's what we want. That Whatsapp is worth 5 stars!"
5,My experience is great.....I just don't like the delay in call display after the call. I have to restart so that I can check how long the call was. I just wish this could be automated
1,"The one star is for the update involving emojis,gifs and stickers - before the update I gave the app 5 stars. In the past you could see rows and rows of emojis...in the new update if you type a few lines you are ok however if you write paragraphs only the first line of emojis show and sometimes none of them are showing. You also cannot increase the block to see more emojis! Finding emojis now is really difficult. Bigüëéfor this update. Please fix this issue!!!"
4,it's a great app to contact your loved ones and friends...BUT when sharing videos and images it decreases the quality extremely.Its honestly very annoying and I hope it gets fixed in the future.
2,"my network speed is good and rest of everything is going on but Whatsapp calls not connecting, mobile model one plus 5t, all apps are up to date but still what is the problem I can't understand, when i call to some one ringing and showing same at the time of lifting it is changing to connecting and finally call could not connect message"
1,I used my pixel 6a for 3 hours sot and found that the fully charged battery is 51 percent . I checked the battery stats and found that 11 min video call and 6 min of background activity of WhatsApp has eaten 41 percent of my phone's battery. That's too much . That's a very serious issue . I hope I could have given zero star . But that's not an option
4,"Respectfully, the ""update"" tab is just honestly messed up üò≠.. it's also a bit irritating for some of us users to get used to this new feature but i do hope that you could change this.. or maybe u should make a new tab specially for the channels only? That would be much more convenient for us thanks :)"
2,Whenever I restart my phone all of a sudden whatsapp gets Uninstalled by itself but all the other applications are totally fine. There is a problem with the back up also. Can you guys please look into the issue. Thank you.
3,"Its messenger app very easy to use and friendly user experience very useful in daily basis. But its still need to be optimized both app and desktop, hope it didnt take our data too."
5,Love this app. It should come as standard on all phones instead of all the other bloatware manufacturers insist on giving you. Particularly like the video message function which I tried today. Keep up the good work!
3,App is doing well and good. New features are getting excited to use. But the major drawback is the quality of video or photo is getting worst while posting in status.
1,End-to-end encrypted. After turning on it starts asking for password without entering it. Data is not restored without password. In this way all the data will be destroyed. This is bad meta security.
2,Disagrees with new update. Now keypad settings changed u guys. It's difficult for us to navigate between emojis. It's now on top. Difficult to use. Fix as old as soon possible. 2 star only
1,"Scammers did messaged over WhatsApp. I was playing along for good 2-3 hours. After sometime conversation completed changed. Original owner of the number got access back, he enquired me about why I'm texting him. All previous scam conversation was deleted from his account. Original owner told me that he was getting notifications on his phone but WhatsApp was not showing any messages to him. It's very disturbing to see the security compromised this way."
4,It is a good application to communicate with each other in a speed and simple way. It is the best messenger app as it sends every message in a safe and secure way and it also sends the message within a few seconds.
1,"The new update is full of bugs. When trying to send a sticker, often the chat disappears. And if you click on the sticker, it either won't send or it'll send twice."
4,it is a very good and useful service and application... but it is very difficult to use fingerprint lock when my finger is wet because of this very hot weather... it'd be a very good change to implement face recognition and/or PIN and/or pattern (i mean regular device lock)
1,Uploading videos are really terrible. The compression makes the quality of the vid like 360p. There's not a single setting to change it anyways. Please change it
2,"I originally gave 4 stars, but for a few days now my account is constantly getting blocked daily at random. It shows, ""account blocked due to spam"". Even if there was any spam report, this is happens randomly everyday. The account gets restored for sometime and again gets blocked without any notice or anything. I hope you look into this"
3,"i have used whatsapp for nearly five years now and it worked perfectly fine! apparently, whenever my relatives or my friends post a video, it doesn't save into my camera roll! what is going on? have you stopped this? please fix this because i love watching whatsapp videos on my phone!"
1,There's a security hole in wa groups. Blocked contacts can still see you and your messages in common groups. - There should be a similar feature like facebook in which you become invisible when you block someone. I reported this long time ago and no response. - There should be also an option to no one can add you to any group IF YOU DON'T WANT TO !!! Less stupid features and more privacy next updates Still the same BS - July 24 / 2023 Nothing fixed nothing changed !!!
5,"Status time duration increase into atleast 45 seconds, because put a song as status -we can't fully feel it,when we splitup the status at middle ,will get interrupted as a break of that song also like other content also,In instgram we get 45 sec more than that.as user please check it out if you can sir, faithfully USER."
1,Missing vocals during video call getting worst every single time. I think it's time to find a new app to communicate. Such a shame very disappointed.
4,WhatsApp has excellent features but only thing that disappoints me is breakage of photo/vedio quality while sending others and while uploading status. Struggled alot to fix it and still struggling.pls fix it as soon as possible.
4,"I've been using it since 2019, the team had always tried to make it better but the video calling issue is still not resolved, video quality was never clear, and voice it is way more worst, try to resolve this issue."
4,Truly it's a fantastic app. But lately it just won't work. Sometimes I can't receive or send any messages. It just stops by itself. Even now it just stopped and I can't send or receive any messages. Please fix this problem. I kindly request you to help me by this problem.
1,Its always Blurry video calls and reconnecting video call problem and status not uploading of 720p videos in vi sim and normal 360p video status also gets stuck at beginning only after uploading status which was not working what the hell WhatsApp I'm fed up with this..... And when i see my status viewers when i click viewers button the status gets stuck in low end devices what the hell is this whatsapp please fix rhis problem asap.......
5,Hello! since couple of months I am unable to record voice with Whatsapp. It only record duration of 0:01 or 0:02. I have tried multiple tips and tricks but the problem still not solved. I have restored and update my Android phone 2-3 times and unfortunately still not working. Please help me with this issue.
1,Without any reason logged me out from this app and again when I reinstall two verification step is required but I forgot my PIN and waited for Seven days to solve this problem but I can't do it every time they send me a code but I don't receive any code to put in the stipulated time. and finally I didn't get it done only haressing me I don't have any other device.The problem stays.
3,I use this app for my LDR. So when it messes up it ruins the time we have together. including when it goes so slow none of my messages are sending and get stuck on sent not delivered. Need to fix this please.
1,Recently changed phone and had to install latest version of WhatsApp and its really infuriating as it doesn't offer the option of audible notifications. I'm missing loads of important/urgent messages.
3,"I love the features, BUT captions on pictures are not included when forwarded to your status. They post separately. ...and two, I suggest that you make the status topology an open one that allows people to see other people's comment on your status. It will really be a distributed interactive environnement where a single post will gather different people to share their opinions among each other. Users should have options to set posts for either public interactions or a private reply to their post"
4,Amazing app but it would be even better if an option called create alarm was added so we could send it to our friends phone so they would talk to us (if the people who created this app see's this please add an option where you go onto the three dots press more and there is an option called create an alarm then I can send it and they will talk to you but add it on the three dots of contacts so you press on the contact you want then press more then create alarm) thx for your time
2,"Very poor to be honest. I have been using whatsapp as my daily driver messenger app for a long time but recently my number got banned from whatsapp for absolutely no reason. Although it has ""apparently"" been restored, but i still cannot log into my account. It keeps saying I need the official whatsapp to use this account BUT I AM USING THE OFFICIAL WHATSAPP FROM PLAYSTORE. PLEASE KINDLY FIX THIS PROBLEM."
1,Since the last update the emoji panel has been a nightmare whenever I type something and want to insert an emoji the text gets rumbled and the keyboard is jammed. It's the worst and the usability has been difficult.
3,The experience is good and love the platform my only challenge is now and then I can't play videos in the app. It's always saying there's an error it can't play the video
1,"Honestly not good at all, my account just keeps getting blocked with valid/concrete reasons. Imagine getting blocked twice in one day for an account I just recently opened. Its really not nice at all. Before locking us out of our account why not check and review the account first. I can't get important messages on time because I'm waiting for my account to be restored. Please something should be done about that thanks."
1,I was using the whatapp from sometime. But suddenly it is showing u account was banned. And to my knowledge I have never did any wrong. So I have raised the issue with support. They have not provided the correct reason . Then I have created a WhatsApp using my second number then also within 24hours account was banned. Hear the bad things is whatts support team is not providing any support for issues and not providing the reason why it was closed. Let's go for made in India telegram
1,"To be honest with the developers,the WhatsApp messenger is becoming boring with recent updates. To cut complaints short, I don't see any status update from friends anymore since I updated the App. I really don't know what's happening. You ought to resolve these challenges as early as possible... ...... Thanks!"
3,"Have difficult experience of application. I uninstalled WhatsApp and reinstalling it again but process stops mobile number verification. I am not getting verification code. I tried several times to resend code request but it didn't work, also reported issue on application yet no response."
3,"WhatsApp really needs to innovate for themselves, they steal features and literally have zero of their own uniquely useful feautures. One essential missing feature is something of the sort of ""Folders"" that Telegram has. There are labels but those are just for business accounts, and those of us who don't need WhatsApp business (students, teenagers, normal working people) need something on the normal app to somehow organise chats and utilize that efficiently."
3,My whatsapp is usually giving me warning for band. My accout is band 2 time in two months. I don't know why my whatsapp is band. I am feeling that I have to learn how to use whatsapp. I want a solution of this problem. I am worried. I am unable to contact with my friends. Please help me by solving this issue. Thank uüòû‚ù§
4,"It's WhatsApp the best and most used app on my phone it's plain and simple make a chat make a group or even a comunity it's all so cool and practical . But one thing anoyes me, That you can't (online) search for a profile picture on you own profile, see you can do that in groupchats and comunitys BUT NOT ON YOUR OWN PROFILE PICTURE!? like why it would be so much cooler!? Please just add that you can search for your profile picture online just do it please"
2,"Whatsapp status Video quality is not great at all. It always makes the videos blurry and bad quality. Even if I reduce the size of the video before uploading it still gives bad quality. Can't you guys update it and have video status quality like instagram, Facebook, YouTube..."
1,Chat backup and its restore process are the worst part of this app. It never restore the backup chat. There must be a smooth way for this. Backuping on drive and restoring it from there is such a tedious task it takes the whole day for that and then also not restore properly
2,I'm beginning to dislike this App. My messages do popup and cover my screen when i'm off whatsapp activity and then indicate that I have read the message by thicking blue even when i'm not with my phone which the sender may think i am ignoring them. Kindly see to this feedback
1,The new update has broken the emoji part of the android keyboard when swiping right to reply... The keyboard becomes miniscule in size and u can't see any emojis... Crazy that they haven't tested this... Everyone who has updated is facing the same issue.
1,1. Having an annoying bug within chat interface and keyboard. 2. Lagging calls and video calls even though the line is 4G and having a good connectivity. 3. Zoomed-in capture of photo.
4,"Great app! I just need for us to be able to post videos more than 30s on our status because it would be easier and better for the people, and that makes us give better reviews. So if you're reading this, I beg of you to try and make this possible. Then I will for sure come back and give 5 starts üòä Thank you‚ô°"
2,What have you done to the latest updates? We cannot delete our own status easily like before. We can't search our contacts' status but have to scroll from top to bottom just to find one perticular person's update? Nonsense! Please revert to the previous version. Sorry but I gave you 2 stars for now.
1,What's app Set status video songs lyrics will be missed and joining another lyrics in same song. Sending photos are view point very slowly load....very most irritating app & bad features.status bug clear ur team Voice message Microphone is not working.sending voice message is not working
4,"The beauty of WhatsApp comes from its simplicity. But I have one problem with it. When someone send me a Document, video, photo and I didn't download it at the same time or soon. It refuse to be downloaded and keep write the massage that say (download failed) so please solve this problem"
1,"Not a fan, because I dislike that it changes every emoji/emoticon. They don't match what's displayed on my standard Google keyboard. I only use WhatsApp to keep in contact with my elderly mom because it shows a ""last seen"" message and also provided read receipts before RCS was available on Android."
1,I lost a contact and in Syira My phone was hacked and couldn't get them back because the the numbers was lost. Plus I had to change my number. All I keep getting is a bunch of responses saying everything looks OK. And we don't see anything wrong with your account.
3,"Whenever I post a status on whatapp, it always loses the quality of the picture/video, it gets blurry and the video details gets ripped. Please solve this issue otherwise WhatsApp is a 10 on 10 messaging app."
1,"Few month very poor experience in WhatsApp crash Hi Team Meta, I am using Whatsapp App on for many years. Recently, While opening the Whatsapp, I am facing the issue mentioning ""whatsapp runtime exception"" with message ""Whatsapp is experiencing the crashes, please contact Whatsapp customer service for a solution"". Kindly look into this and guide me how to fix this issue. Thanks in advance. Regards, Nitin Sharma"
1,"When I mute a group chat I still get a pop up saying ""checking new messages"" sometimes, which is annoying too. Also the new update when you slide up to send stickers is horrible, it fulls the whole screen and I can't see the previous chat."
4,"Really good app, but having a serious issue with the new feature 'chat lock' each time I try to activate it I keep getting an error message that reads ""something went wrong, pls try again later"" I have updated my app and tried severally but the error message still remain."
2,"The new emoji/sticker interface is unstable and makes it harder to select sets and pick emojis and stickers, not easier. I've over a thousand stickers favourited, plus sticker sets. It was doable before. Not any more."
3,"I am not getting the message notification and to recieve call i have to open what's app and enter to the contact to recieve call. What's going on please do the needful. After update, during video call, the size of the screen automatically decreases, please review the latest version of WhatsApp."
2,"App should go back to the old emoji, gif and sticker panels, its easier to change if i want to send a sticker and then an emoji. Also, the sticker section, the new update keeps making the sticker go to the first sticker pack instead of my recent sticker which is super annoying."
1,"Suddenly I got message that "" Today whatsapp suddenly gave me notification that "" Your phone number is no longer registered with WhatsApp on this phone..."" Then it required me to register. But could enter two-step verification pin (I dont have access and could get it via email ).This problem happened to so many people from Azerbaijan. Please fix this issue as soon as possible"
3,"All Ok after new update...but you need to add back ""search"" feature at status (Updates)...so provide this feature as soon as possible cause whenever any person want to see any persons status(right it now it is as ""Updates"") all people need to scroll down so it not good for everyone its take more time to find out someone status(Updates)....so provide back that feature because it is good features it WhatsApp..."
2,"The new and ""improved"" emoji menu drives me crazy!!!! It's so slow with that animation and my finger wants to press the first emojis where they once were. Now I have to wait 3 seconds and then find my way to the first emoji. Such a useless change that only a smooth brain would make."
3,"If you can develop a feature to cluster same type of WhatsApp groups & one-to-one messages under some category names which users can create & rename, e.g., work groups, family groups, friend groups, new acquaintances etc. I am not sure if I could express the need clearly or my expectations are too high. Please Consider the possibility. Improve WA web too. Msgs take a long time to load & sometimes they are not at all there in the web version-unreliable. Don't u think? The App crashes too."
5,"A new suggestion Can you do a new update..? If you can, it will make a big difference... Idea I will tell you‚Ä¶ include an emergency alert button in WhatsApp groups.. It should be possible to voice sent with that emergency button... When that voice message is sent to the group Other members of the group should have a different ringtone (ex: police siren/other) as an emergency alert.. The alarm should continue until the message is opened.. This one update will be useful in many local disaster"
4,This app is good. I gave it 4 stars because there is a new feature chat lock. In that feature you have not provided to set a pattern of our choice you have added by default screen lock pattern. I hope you will fix this iissue
3,The app was perfect till now But the new update is ruining the smooth experience Specially and specifically the Emoji and sticker section is very bad The transition animation to switch into emoji takes a lot of time The placement of the button to clear emoji is also changed and a lot of things have been changed with negative effects Please make the emoji section like it was before
1,Definitely dislike the new update that you put the unnecessary channel and whatnot. It is much appreciated if you could increase the pictures instead of this channel things. üòÆ‚Äçüí® **Bring back the mute status update.
5,Hi WhatsApp! I like this app very much because it keeps me connected with my friends and family but these days I am just facing problems to connect to my WhatsApp account it shows the message to use official WhatsApp for login while I am using this WhatsApp messenger so kindly help me fix it as soon as possible because I am having a great loss due to this inaccessibility.
5,"Amazing, WhatsApp is now approving day by day! I suggest to add and edit conversation categories in which ones can add their relevant chat members to the categorized groups, Like family friends, coworkers and more. And individually hover them and easily can find them, through quick access."
1,"Please allow an option to block unknown numbers!!! I keep getting spam from numbers, not in my contact list from people who live in other countries. What's up doesn't have an option to block numbers, not in my contact list. The only option I have now is to delete the whatsapp app."
3,Please change the emoji layout back to normalüò≠. I hate sending emojis now. It completely disrupts the flow of a conversation and I get lost in looking for an emoji scrolling endlessly. Why do you guys do updates that are a total discomfort?üò≠üò≠üò≠ The colours that this new update has are just so eye-straining! I really want them to change the colours back to what they were as it's quite painful for my eyes cause of the fluoroscent colours used.
5,I want to suggest an idea for the searching words in the Chats menu. Let there be a search option that could provide results for exact phrases instead of only providing results for each individual word.
1,"Worst support ever! They simply answer with an AI system that does not understand the problem. An actual person which would read through the explanation might help, but not AI. My WA for PC shows that my version is outdated, but I have the latest on my phone and my desktop. The link for the new download on my WA desktop closes the window, but never offers a page of the new version. And the Microsoft link on their download page does never actually open though I tried with 4 different browsers."
5,"Whatsapp is mahh WORLD seriously I mean if this app didn't existed then I don't know what I might have done. I can't live without this app, I spend most of the day in this app chatting with mahh loved ones. It's grt for chatting and voice call, video call quality is also good if you have proper network connection. I call alot. I Call everyone most of the time because I don't like chatting so for my experience it's good!"
1,The recent update is terrible. As people are already commenting about the emoji/gif menu being a disaster I'd request you to please stick to the previous design as it was super convenient for us to use emojis/gifs/ stickers way easily.
3,"It is really frustrating for me right now. In the last couple of days since i changed phone and logged out from the former to the new, i have had the problem of having to register and summit registration after i would have been logged out of whatsapp and will have to wait for 24 hours for review and after it's been restored, same thing repeats itself after re-registering and the same cycle begin again . What am i supposed to do?"
1,The recent video voice chat is rubish. Whenever we texting it seems to be hurdle over there. Whenever we press sent option at that time voice and video voice option exchanges and sometime the sent option is faded and not shown.
5,This is app is totally fantastic. I love how it adds new features on daily-basis and does not shows adds and all those things. It allows us to do anything we want to. Amazing application üíúüñ§üí≠
1,My contact is not verified after many attempts and the care seem not to have solutions. I have been kicked out of my account for weeks that am using unofficial WhatsApp. I asked when WhatsApp messenger and WhatsApp business turned unofficial and I got no solution. It's very annoying and frustrating that after many complaints no solution is in sight. Worst experience with WhatsApp
3,"The chat lock feature needs to be more updated because I have a problem with it, I can't share anything in the locked chats. If I search any locked chat it doesn't show anything. So I'm requesting you to fix this soon as possible... Waiting for your reply.."
1,This is the Worst update and Worst UI changes I ever seen in whatsapp. Please revert back the changes to previous version. Smileys and stickers tabs are covering the text input field. Unable to see what we are typing. There is no 0.0 rating otherwise I will give 0 rating .
4,"In Last few weaks when make a call, opposite person ""can't hear my voice"" or some time automatically shows 'RECONNECTING'. It's disturbing to call. Kindly do something to clear this problem."
2,"The in-app camera is horrendously bad. It just refuses to focus. The auto focus is never accurate, and the manual focus is just as bad. I find myself tapping away at the screen to try and get the shot into focus but it's almost always to no avail and in the end I almost always have to resort to the phone camera app. This issue exists almost exclusively for the rear camera."
3,"I am facing the problem of showing notification about ""you are no longer member"". How to exit such community/group message notification?? I mean how to exit and end that community message and notification?? If it could be possible, I might have shared the picture of my issue."
2,"Whoever made the new ui for emojis, gifs and stickers.. It is really a downgrade, now everytime i need to search, or just select something, it moves me away from the ones i tried to select... just revert the changes, it was way better"
2,This app modifing worst day by day.. images and videos getting blured while sending or keeping on status.. whatsapp can't handle images and videos of advance mobile phones and cameras. This app needs to resolved this issue.. as this issue exist more than 4 yrs.. and no resolution yet.
1,Consume a lot of my battery. I don't know what the problem is. But I'm clean flash and reset my phone a few times and still have the bug. 1. *job*/com.whatsapp/androidx.work.impl.background.systemjob.SystemJobService#4uniquenumber like thousand of it active for 1 minutes 2. uba171 *overflow* Detect the wakelock on every custom ROM. Low deep sleep causing a lot of my battery consumed. Using batteryguru app to measure. Hope address the issue. The issue just started around 3 week past after app upd
2,"I don't like the new layout for updates combine with status. Your guys should not combine it. I more prepare if it's in new page. So on the top have 4 section, which is chat, status, updated/channel, and calls."
1,When I Reply a Specific message with Swipe function. The keyboard is not opening. Every time click on Chat input box to open keyboard. It is very bad. When we swipe a messge for reply the keyboard should open automatically. please improve them without that whatsapp is very ugly. When Click on Emoji the Animation is slow and Ugly.
1,"Some messages I deleted and i wanna restore it so I backup on Google drive and attach my Google account. And i delete WhatsApp for restoration and what i see my Google account doesn't attached without any network issue. My all data are just vanist. And now I am suffering for my old important messages, video, audio and some other datas."
1,"The user interface with the latest update is so poor! It's important for apps to keep their unique identity while evolving their user interface, the updates should ensure usability without loosing the app's original charm!"
3,"The app is great. However the formatting is inconsistent between Apple and Android. An Apple user may send what seems to be a perfectly formatted message, but the Android recipient sees a mess, because it follows a slightly different algorithm. I've tried reporting this within the app, but just got told to try reinstalling! I can't get the so-called customer service team to accept my feedback."
3,"Hey Whatsapp developers, seriously tell me were you high on the day while making updates on whatsapp. ""Why did you change the emoji settings. Why the delete and other gif and sticker section is brought upper side and emoji showings on down. And why animation speed gets lower while opening sticker section"". Please change this settings to previous one. This one is very nasty to use just change it quickly."
2,"Your update inconvenient. It doesn't need some channel it makes some phone laggy from that. Remove that, it sucks. Just stop add more stew-pid new option on future update. I like the version before it was update like this. The channel is useless, even some kids may press it and get out from that chat. Maybe some hackers will enter the channel chat and make us Whatsapp user suffer. If you fix it, thanks a lot"
5,"For some reasons, I have not been able to watch any video on Whatsapp, both on status updates, on ground chats and in dms. My Whatsapp is updated to the latest version Please, Whatsapp, fix this!!!! Side note: Nothing should happen to my chats. üëÄüëÄüëÄ Problem fixed. üëç"
3,"whatsapp has been amazing and great but recently, the way the quality of video and pictures are reducing is way out of it. Videos become blurry kind of and pictures extremely ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. uploading dp,it becomes blur,sending pictures way too blur. This is called for a change"
3,I was able to select high quality media in settings. now I have to manually select hd quality in photos and videos I'm sending. why can't I set default as hd all the time. why did u remove that option.
2,Even after enable the password protection still messages can be read with notification without unlocking the WhatsApp app itself. This is a bit strange. Hope you will fix it. Thank you
1,"Dear WhatsApp developer are you completely high or something? Your WhatsApp features chat transfer from old phone to new phone, as the instructions says login to new phone with same number then scan th qr code , but when I login into new phone it logs out automatically from old phone , now how can I able to scan qr code from old phone , and I couldn't get my data back . Why should you focus on privacy when you cannot provide simple , basic , common features.. ,, Telegram I am coming"
2,"The app was easy and cool before, but I'm not really like the new update regarding the iconic status menu changing into ""Updates""... Why does it also need to be closed? It feels annoying having to press the button to see my friends' statuses. Also, what happend to seeing my own status? Why do I have to click every post one by one to get to the one I want to find? It's annoying and irrelevant! Whatsapp you are perfect the way you were, please no more updates!"
3,"It's a great app overall, but the recent update has caused the emoji keyboard to be so small, you can barely type on it. Even if you swipe up to make it bigger it's still so small. Please fix this."
1,"What a disgusting upgrade.... Look, I've used Whatsapp for about ten years now, great app and all. I've always loved it, until now. Why did you have to change the position, location and the way you send emojis, stickers and gifs? Furthermore; why did you have to make it in a way that's so slow? If it was a personal opinion I wouldn't even complain. But man... it isn't personal. Everyone who I chat with using whatsapp is complaining as well. I know it's a little change, but it's for worse."
2,"The compatibility is really bad with the s23+, many features are missing. I don't have the video thing that replace the voice button when you tap on it."
1,"New update is awful. The new emoji board is clunky and not as intuitive as previously, the new feature to tap the voice note button to swap to video is pointless since the camera allows video anyway."
5,"I think there should be added ""DND"" kinds of features, so when people in a meeting and presentation with Mobile or a student taking Online class then will get rid of distractions. It will probably help in many kinds of things. I know there are also some disadvantages of ""DND"" features, but this is nothing against lots of advantages. If this suggestion is good for the maker's perspective, then please add the feature. Thanks üòä"
1,"Get rid of your stupid ""storage full"" warnings and STOP locking me out!!! Regardless of whether my storage is full, I should still be able to access whatsapp, read texts, and make calls. I am NOT going to waste and spend more time trying to ""free up space"", when you could just freaking REMOVE that stupid screen. Stop locking me out!"
1,"The new stickers update is SO BAD! I can't find the correct ones in time, the stickers slide up by themselves, when I click on the favorites section, it doesn't get clicked. BRING THE OLD STICKER SECTION BACK PLEASE"
3,It was good but now it isnt responding well. Dps of people seen exchanged from upper and lower contacts in list and shows glitch... It also not enables me to change filters when positing status. So i got disappointed üíî
1,"Recently I noticed not sure if it's a bug or new feature. I am using WhatsApp dual for my both numbers. I was on call on my primary WhatsApp and same time I received call on my secondary WhatsApp. When I answered the call, my primary WhatsApp call was also active and I can hear the voice and talk from both calls(kind of confrence)... Ideally it should be on hold. Only 1 active call at a time. Please check."
1,"There is a issue in which my account gets logged out on its own and when I try to login with my contact number again it does not support the login feature and I have tried it multiple times but the result is same and it is asking for my official whatsapp to login to my account and it is not getting logged in from that as well,please fix this as soon as possible because I am not able to see my important data."
2,The last update was too much for a user to accept. Too many changes at once. It was better simple and not too loaded with options in the stories/channels update. Hope you take that into consideration.
1,Text timestamps and the app's overall date are incorrect. I get 2001 timestamp for the messages I send meanwhile the date of my previous chats has been changed to 2045. This happened after I updated the app and none of the other messaging apps that I use have this problem.
4,"It's good , please üôè add offline backup system and more better online backup system . And please üôè üôèüôèüôè please add multiple accounts options and switch account options . My Cousin and friends also wanted to use WhatsApp on my mobile but it would delete my account and my Data if try to , so no option for switching account , it's necessary needed ."
5,"This App is really good and it gets better at every update. However, if it were possible for status to be automatically repeated as per settings, it will help entrepreneurs to always have their goods and services on their status even when they may be too busy to upload."
1,Really frustrating working with WhatsApp to create a community. We have a legitimate community as a golf club and have been trying to set this up on WhatsApp for a while now. The number was flagged once because we added too many members at a time (we think.. we don't know). It gets unbanned but as soon as we add as little as 6 names it just gets banned again immediately. Then we have to wait 24 hours for assistance and have to try again. Truly frustrating. If only one could call someone!
4,"Good app but... It needs a way to customize who can call. Currently, if someone has your number, they can just call you whenever, regardless if you have messaged or added them to contacts before. This means that complete strangers you haven't interacted with before can call. It would be nice if there was a settings page where you can say ""Only allow calls from contacts"". That way, people cannot call you unless you've added them as a contact."
2,"Useful, but please increase the quality of the photo and video, everytime I send something, the quality of it so low and blurry. Remove the new update of channels, please. Or make it invisible to see, My eyes hate it."
1,"It's not fun now. Why don't you put link or connect status from Whatsapp to fb status. I more like before than now . You should put that again. And I not agree if I have to see all of my status if I want to choose one. It waste time and I not feel happy to do that. Last not less I not agree it not show what's last time we post our status, but it show our last seen. It's not relevant at all. Plez fit it just before. I love before than now."
4,"Compression on media that you share is way over the top. Not sure why there isn't an option to disable it, or even a subscription fee if people want the feature to disable compression on shared media, etc."
2,"You guys have pledged to upset the costumers by bringing unnecessary, pathetic updates to the app which are not even required nor is anyone asking you to.... every other day it's a new change in app which makes it difficult for us to even use. Just when we are adapting to a change another one comes by! Just do something else instead of constantly changing one app! Or leave the job if you dont even have anything else productive to do"
2,I want you to fix the sticker bug as fast as possible...I'm not able to send sticker I made through sticker.ly..whatsapp just ignoring them as they just do not exit and when j click on their icon it doesn't responds ..i need you to clear it asap.
3,"Hi, my whatsapp is not working since yesterday. The Android app is not opening only. I tried restarting my device and reinstalling the app multiple times. After reinstalling, the app opens but the very next time, it's shows the same error. I mailed in customer support but there's been no resolution yet. Please help me resolve the issue as soon as possible. It's causing a lot of inconvenience."
1,"I've been using WhatsApp for many years and the latest update is the worst update ever whenever I'm on voice call or video call there's a pop up scree said poor signal try moving around and then the video quality because very poor, I'm hopeful that this will fix soon."
4,REALLY UBIQUITOUS APP. VERY WONDERFUL!!!üî•üî•üî• But they could make it possible to edit written status updates incase of mistakes. Pls reply. And add more to what you've said on a voicemessage. Also pls make it possible that Status will automatically divide videos into 30secs itself cos it's difficult to divide manually.
1,Worst app ever the edit function is also not fully useful what is the means of edit when we cannot edit after 15mins of sending the message and also worst media sending algorithm and quality always compresses my videos and photos. Worst app ever üò†üò†üò†
2,"I dont like the new version ! please change the status update back ! we need the old one where we can choose which one need to be deleted or not. and please dont skip the status that we cant send because we want to delete it so we can post it back instead of seeing the ""red line"". ASAP !"
1,"An error has occurred on my whatsapp stating there is a bug. Please fix it soon. The premise of the problem is that it does not allow me to make calls. I go on the app, make a call. It kicks me out with no notice. It says that it's a bug and that I should wait till you update the app, but it's a real big issue on the overall thing since I can't even call someone. Then the calling bar appears on the top and u can't hang up, not like they're listening anyway since the calling doesn't work. Pls fix"
3,"Appreciate WhatsApp's effort in updating the UI, but the recent changes feel disorienting. Navigating and adapting to the new layout is a challenge. The color scheme shift is also jarring. Hoping these changes become more familiar over time. User feedback could help refine the UI. Thank you."""
1,"Many more to improve. Now Chat lock option is provided which is totally useless.. After locking chat, the Locked Chat icon can be seen at the top of all chats. Anyone can see that some chat is being locked and they may ask to unlock it and show the chat. What is the use of Chat Lock security option if other can see that some chat is been Locked & hidden ? The 'Locked Chat' option should be hidden. Provide it under menu drop-down options so that no one will come to know about locked chats"
3,There are several issues with the new update. The most disturbing one is that when I send a message of emojis it doesn't appear before I minimize the keyboard.
1,"The system of this app is good but the problem is whenever l keep any video as my status it shows that ""there is an error please send another video"" and when l keep another video it again shows the same thing. Please check the problem."
1,"I have trouble forwarding messages. When I attempt to forward a message, it doesn't take me to the list of my contacts. Instead, it keeps loading. Initially, it'd load for about a minute or so before showing me my contacts, but now if I don't cancel the operation, I'm sure it'd keep loading forever. I sought help with whatsapp help, but no avail. I cleared my cache. It's making the app awfully difficult for me to use. If not for some official contacts on my whatsapp, I'd have long deleted it."
1,This app is good. But the voice and video recording in the app is not available as everyone can record manually and speak... This is the disadvantage to this app and there is no pinning of chats more than 3.... fix this issue...
4,Hi this should be an important update for this app to make.. Hence we tried a fraud on his phone location unless he turned off his phone on airplane mode or he removed his sim card frm phone.. He using WhatsApp call by connecting a WiFi or unknown source for non traceable his location.. Don't allow for these kind of frauds to escape by using your app.. Bring your app to trace his location.. And shut all the loop for those frauds to escape..
1,"I don't know how it survives in this industry. Very outdated app. Minimum features. Any time that changed my phone, I had issues with transferring my chat. It's so annoying. Horrible app."
1,"The new emoji keyboard sucks A$$. It opens at 1/4 the normal keyboard size, the first row still invisible. Having to drag up to max half the old size. The top emoji/gif buttons take up so much space, leaving only a few emotes visible. Who thought this was a good idea?"
3,"Chat box/typing field is periodically disappearing for some reason. Reappears on its own or when exiting and returning to a chat. This just started in the last few days. Came here to check if theres a pending update patch for it, but not yet it seems."
4,"It is very good that you have added an additional privacy feature by using fingerprint. Could you please add the lock feature by using the pin of 4 digits. Also on punching the correct pin, the app automatically log in."
4,"Used this app for a long time. There are no ads... yet. But this is probably my main way of contacting people. So if won't surprise me when Zuckerberg does start charging for it. I'm not sure how much data it steals. But a lot of them do these days, so... encrypted? Doubtful."
2,"A very good comitication app but every time I am calling with someone while playing, and I want to open my WhatsApp text messages, It always bring me to the call, not the text messages I want to see. So every time I am playing while calling, and I want to see the text... I keep getting disconnected from my game. And sometimes when I want to text in whatsapp, I can't type!!! I have to restart the whatsapp thing eveytimeee!!!!"
5,"So far WhatsApp is good for communication and many more. Security is now more secured and feel comfortable to use. But we really want message translation.But we want a option for translating the message , so we can understand much better for communication."
5,"Super useful way to check and reply to your WhatsApp messages using your watch. The UI is great, and you can even see pictures that are sent to you."
3,"Really good app. I have an issue with video quality. When I send videos to someone or to my status, whatsapp reduces the video quality a lot. I would appreciate if this could be resolved"
2,"I really appreciated this app until this thing happened... Like everything was going fine the app was doing a great job untill I updated it in the latest version, after that I tried to put something by the copy paste option in bio.. but it was just showing ' couldn't update, try again' I kept doing it for 4 to 5 times and nothing happened, thought to do it any other day but it's STILL not updating! .... Pls WhatsApp community needs to work on this! üôèüèª"
3,Hi. Love the new features of WhatsApp allowing us to share screen but would ya make it even more possible if during my screen sharing moment ... You allowed my face to be shown.. not closed. Like now if I turn on screen sharing during video call my video cam will closed if you could make it to be shown I would be happier.
3,"I am still not happy about the fact that one still needs an another app to download and save statuses, like why? That's annoying. Couldn't we just get an actual update, an option to save statuses while on what'sapp? No guys."
2,"Absolutely no idea what happened. Been using this app for years but recently when I post Videos on my status. Only the first 2-5 seconds play, then it glitches and goes no further. I've updated the software on my phone and WhatsApp. So I actually have no idea what's happening. Please fix this..."
2,"Recent update is a disaster! Especially the fact that now the app drains the battery like crazy ü§Ø It's always top1 usage with 40%+ from the full battery, aka ""background usage"" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I wish I'd just be able to erase this garbage from my phone, but it helps to connect with so many wonderful people ü•≤"
2,"Okay it's an okay aap but i would like to add few things. Please add a username feature so that students can hide phone number. Like school related groups i don't really want to share my number but people see it regardless. Please do something about it if you can ,well unknown people are messaging me ... Like yesterday someone from class said Hi and I have no idea who he is and i am an introvert and don't want to make him friends. Solution: telegram contact settings are best for privacy."
1,Contacts are not uploading on the WhatsApp ... Still we remove account from settings and then refresh it but still contacts are not uploading on WhatsApp..i always taken help from WhatsApp support but they are liers they dont help us i dont like this version of whatsapp kindly give us back the previous WhatsApp version... kindly solve this problem as soon as possible otherwise we will report on this WhatsApp account app .

Please solve this issue üôè üòî"
1,"I have no idea why but my WhatsApp is not showing playback speed option. I have reinstated the app many times. I sent messages to WhatsApp help service,even they are unable to resolve this issue. Pls help me if someone knows how to fix this problem."
1,I wish I could reverse to the previous version where my stickers were separated through tabs up at the menu. This new version scrolls all the way to find the group you want. Such bad usability.....
5,"WhatsApp is my favorite app so far ,in as far as most communications are concerned. Easier for me to reach someone quickly in messaging, and calls, as well as offering video calls. With Whatsapp ,messenger is cheaper to reach someone outside my Country. I can also send attachments,etc. A video is wonderfully placed as I am able to talk to someone face to face. This is an amazing experience."
1,"Should have the build in function of select which backup to restoring local chat history instead of forcing restore from drive, which makes people struggling if accidently skip the restoration and the new empty chat being updated to drive. Tried retrieve history from Databases folder but all failed with force drive linking while migrate to new phone."

5,"Very great app that always has the latest updates and keeps you updated , chatting with friends is like cutting cake , very good experience and really helpfull when it comes to talking or asking people online, also allows you to call anyone video/call to talk with siblings or friend l recomand this app a 5 star anyone searching for a app to chat on here is an idea"
1,App is overall nice but i get a notification the whole 365 days... It reads 'checking for new messages' and i cannot send anyone any message or cannot see someone else's message i updated the app and did everything i could but it still doesnt fix.... Please tell me a solution for it ans if it gets fixed i will give this app 5 stars and edit this review PLEASE TELL ME A SOLUTION üíÄ
3,It reduces the quality of posting a video to status it totally reduces the original quality of the video. Nd the latest features which is hd sending videos options they could increase the resulations to 1080p to 4khd etc. please solve the problems so that we can have a good services üòä‚ñ™Ô∏é‚ñ™Ô∏éthank you! üôè
1,Need a Fix on the Smiley/Sticker Drawer Urgently after the recent update. It constantly keeps on moving up and down. Need a way to revert it back to the previous version !!!
1,"It was good until last update. But after update, backup is stuck at 99% every time. Even if I cancel backup and restart it, the issue still continues. I will rate 5 stars only which this issue is solved."
1,"Its just 1‚òÖ..........Because,when someone sends me a picture or video in a message, it is automatically saved to my phone storage. Changing the setting does not work. Hope the authorities will fix it soon."
4,"A lot of good things. Only a few bad ones (like you can't send files larger than 100 MB, WA does not provide the facility to store files which we want to remain stored)"
3,"when im about to upload a video on status some of the video cant be uploaded, like im posting short duration video and sometime it can upload to status but sometime cant, please fix this, I want upload video to status and to my friend but sometime it didnt let me upload it. And the sticker tab was kinda annoying because you have to scroll especialy if you have many sticker, and you cant press other sticker fast cause its gonna refresh so I kinda hate it, but please fix the video bug."
2,Need to clear your bugs of WhatsApp status. When we put the status it'll decrease the whole quality of the videos or pictures. All pixels are busted. Really not working whichever trick we will use. Please look through it
5,"Excellent app and I think there should be ""EDIT"" button on status viewer to correct errors we made after we might have uploaded it on our status. Rather than to delete it and then re upload. Kindly work on it. #whatsapp #markZuckerberg"
1,"Respected sir, With you respect, I say that my WhatsApp is not working due to showing message, it is not a official WhatsApp and my number is not verified this message is continuously display whenever I try to login in my account. when ever I change my phone and insert my SIM in another phone, same message also display the phone.kindly look after this problem as soon as possible"
1,Really pathetic update !Totally dissapointing performance . The keyboard is moving upward near the video call icon during giving emoji or sticker . Dear developer have a look on the matter as early as you can .
3,"Not great. I moved from IOS to Android S23 Ultra. I was able to transfer my chats with the move to android feature, which is a thumbs up for me. I feel there are areas where the android version of Whatsapp is lacking compared to IOS. The first of which is the quality of pictures when you post to status. It's very poor, the compression takes out all the details, on IOS it preserves the details even though it compresses. You can't also crop a video before posting, this is possible on IOS. Improve"
1,"On my oneplus 11 when I send a video to a friend, the video is getting shaky dots after being compressed to a lower resolution. This issue is very annoying, request you to please resolve it."
3,"No clue why the change of emoji/chat positioning has happened but it just doesn't work. It's made it so difficult to type, throw in a emoji then type again, and then you need Inspector Gadget fingers to press send. Please change that back üò≠"
1,"The latest update is just wrong. Like üëéüèæ Please, return the ""search"" for statuses/updates and the pop for self statuses; I shouldn't be scrolling endlessly to look for a status I posted. Thank you"
1,"Link devices should be able to add and delete Whatsapp, it's very stressful using my Android phone to add to WhatsApp status all the time, it's not fair, please link devices should be able to add and delete Whatsapp status. That's all thank you."
1,"Hey the fingerprint option is enabled with lock immediately settings saved , still I am able to reproduce a issue only on Android 13, if you unlock WhatsApp and remove it from recent apps, when you open it for the second time it will not ask fingerprint."
1,"Can't connect to whatsapp using new mobile number. When i give the information, they give troubleshooting steps but still can't connect. I tried ask them to delete and do re-registration for my number, but no feedback. Very disappointed because need to use it urgently."
1,"For more than 3 hours I'm trying to install this app. And every time I try to verify my phone number the app keeps telling me can't send verification code to the number, wait till 1 hours and try again, and when i retry the app keeps telling me the same thing. This very frustrating, for a customer of whatsapp for so many years. I'm very disappointed and upset"
5,It's a very great app which I have been using since last 8 years....but recently in the new update where the emojis section is changed I am having many problems.. My app is up-to-date and also I have a high-end device... the animations of mobile keyboard dissapering and emojis section appearing is glitching out due to which I am unable to send emojis or use my keyboard...kindly please bring back the old form!
3,Mine is not an experience it is an issue that has been bothering me for the last week I keep on trying to login but keeps popping up this message that says you need to use the official WhatsApp but I have been using the official WhatsApp and I'm still using it I've tried downloading it uninstalling it and it still doesn't work if you guys could fix this problem it would be of great help thank you
1,ZERO STARS! I won't register my phone. The system keep telling me my number is not a U.S. number BUT IT IS! Help center is a joke every agent keep telling me to the same thing and I keep telling them every troubleshoot offered DOES NOT WORK. There needs to be an agent and a CALL CENTER for real help...WHATS APP IS TRASH
4,"This app does have a function to choose the quality of video to use when sharing or uploading. My video are ballad when they come to WhatsApp, especially my status. Am using Samsung A54 and the video in the gallery are absolutely amazing. When I share or upload on WhatsApp its another thing"
1,Hate the new update. I don't like the fact that the stickers icon has moved to the top. Because now it opens the first stickers pack instead of recents and when you click on recents it has to scroll through every damn sticker to get there
1,"My WhatsApp number is not open in my phone, why is it open in other phones? What's wrong with my device? Why not open in my phone. I complain in whatsApp center, but no reply from help center üëé . I have uninstalled the app and installed again many times but no result. I don't know what's wrong with my device & phone number üòí"
1,"Dear WhatsApp! Yesterday something strange happened.. I'm no longer receiving status sent from all my contacts not even one.. I have just updated it by now, hoping it will change, then asked a friend nearby to sent status. Nothing is happening.. is it new changes??"
1,"I have been banned from using Whatsapp suddenly. I hadn't do anything wrong.this is very bad , I am very mad and disappointed. All my contacts,data , work applications , appointment, all gone... I really can't consider that a good job What's app should use better alogrithms, programs and softwares. they should not ban accounts with there eyes closed.this needs to be more professional!!!"
1,Ever since I downloaded Whatsapp they've been banning my account with the reason that I'm violating their terms of service. I read the terms and services and the privacy policy and I didn't violate any of them. Then I logged in with another number and they banned it again saying too much spam. I had already deleted every spam I had. This has been very frustrating and annoying. I have very important chats there and I can't access them. I would like to know if anyone else has faced this problem.
2,Battery consumption has gone very high with recent updates. Storage is incorrect as in settings it shows almost zero after deleting most chats but in android App info user data is still over 500MB.
1,"I suddenly can not access it. I got stuck in screen that says something like need to restore your chat history from backup. The only way to access my chat room was delete my data (i kept my database prior this deletion) but then i can not retrieve my chat history since i forgot my encryption passworrd for my chat database. Why did you made the whatsapp to get crash in restoring backup screen out of nothing. I was in surgery room, waiting for messages, but then i have to lost all important chats"
1,"Absolute rubbish when you to try to migrate. Crashes all the time, doesn't work, has lost my data and now making me wait 15 minutes to try again. 0 stars if I could. Plenty of better messaging apps around"
2,"It was an unfortunate experience to have my WhatsApp number banned. As a frequent user of the app, I relied on it heavily for communication and staying connected with friends, family, and colleagues. However, the banning of my number has truly left me disappointed and frustrated."
4,"This is an excellent platform to communicate. However, I have a WA Business account with another phone number. I want to carry over those messages to this WhatsApp. So I want to use one account/number but want to take the messages over to one central account. How do I do that without losing the information?"
1,"I absolutely don't like update sbout voice notes. If someone calls it just disappears, if i go out of the chat same happens. I would've actually appreciate if i could record and it wouldn't get deleted. I hope u fix this and next update ll be better."
1,"The new emoji interface is horrible. The absolute worst ""improvement"" anyone could've thought of. Review stays at one star until the interface changes back to the way it used to be."
1,"We planning to move to signal, it can't providing it's services. There is an option for adding popels l, but when I try to add my relatives or my friends to our group, I am getting banned, not only many faing the same problem. And I requested in email, Andi got email to open app and when I enter my number and request for OTP not getting OTP. Please solve this, And We Many planning Switch To Signal Messaging App"
1,Why did you change the emojis? And to replace them with a ridiculously slow animation and rearranging recent ones in real time. So you can't use an emoji twice because it'll move. And the erase buttons apparently on the top now. Why? What's the point on this horrible change? So stupid!
3,Lately I've been experiencing several inconvenience Sometimes by profile photo just deleted itself. And another one... recently I received a notification saying my phone number had been logged out (which is not true)...but the app is smooth and easy to use though
1,"Update: the new emoji bar is extremely annoying, plz change it to the old one. Sending and delivering a message has been a very frustrating process! Messages literally take ages to be delivered"
5,"It's so much better to use this app for the communication with all the best people in the world and that makes things easier for you to call your family and friends through WhatsApp,this is the first app to to do your job and what ever you want to do and not everyone is checking on your view if you don't want, it's so great to have friends on WhatsApp whom you consider as a good friend to chat or to communicate through WhatsApp so recommend to be a member of this app for the good quality off its"
1,I am not able to sign in using my mobile no. I am not receiving the OTP at all by SMS. A timer is setting up stating Try after one hour. Kindly resolve the issue soon. The issue is persisting for last week.
1,"*Status quality and media sharing clarity automatically getting reduced... *The forward option is pathetic. We can forward to only 1 or 5 persons one time. But what for those who's work is connecting multiple people on daily basis?!! We use WhatsApp for that, it's wasting our time... Hope you rectify this... Otherwise we(i.e big organization is planning to use other app for communications)"
5,"Please WhatsApp have not violate the rules and regulations but it's showing ""my account cannot use that whatsApp "" please not less than 24hrs I have access to my phone and this account has really go along way and have never experienced this for once prior to this time. Please assist...I need to have access to my account. Thanks in anticipation"
1,New updates has a very big bug.. 1. Faulty during status upload..whtp not uploading 30 sec status 2. During wifi good connection..msg takes longer tym as compared to cellular data.. Kindly fix this as soon as possible
5,"Next inline of updating is the Chance to edit status, when ever someone post a written status in Whatsapp with a typographic error he or she can't edit. And secondly the chance to tag someone who is on your contact on your status And he or she get notified. Thanks"
1,Hello sir! my whatsapp is showing closed or blocked since yesterday I want to know the reason why my whatsapp has been blocked I always use to follow the terms and condition of WhatsApp's that's why i request whatsapp owner Please solve this problem of mine as soon as possible Because WhatsApp is very important for me and I use it for a lot of my work. I once again request you to solve this problem of mine as soon as possible. Thank you.
2,Just got the new update. WhatsApp story layout looks kinda messy. I like the previous version better. Good idea with the new channel feature but i think its better to put it at another page because now it looks too crowded.
1,Screen sharing feature is fallacious for boys/girls who are in a long distance relationship. As because it's easier to check on phones from anywhere in the world.
1,"i want the older version of whatsappp!!!!! everything is so terrible after the new updates and what in the world does channels do? the keyboard emojis its so terrible.why cant u put a history whatsapp status or make the whatsapp smoother like telegram.and the ""undo"" after delete messages shouldve put in the middle screen bc i always accidentally tab on it and it makes me delete the message again.so whatsapp should improve all of this"
1,Still disappointed with the new feature update. There has been no change when creating a bad video status even though the video quality is good.
1,"Involve users when introducing new features. Channels is a bad feature piled together with status , which of course is a good one. Be creative as we move forward"
1,"1. ""WhatsApp is the ultimate messaging app. It's fast, reliable, and incredibly easy to use. I love how it keeps me connected with friends and family, no matter where they are in the world."" 2. ""WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption gives me peace of mind knowing that my messages and calls are secure. Privacy is a top priority, and that's something I truly appreciate."""
1,"My account is being flagged every other day since 15 weeks now and there is no help from whatsapp support. After reviewing and wasting my time for 4-5hrs, it responds that your sysytem was flagged accidentally. And this happens almost everyday, making my life miserable, as i am primarily dependent on whatsapp for work. Worst experience from WHATSAPP."
1,"For the past 4 months now, watsapp has banned me without any reason, i bought another sim but the app keeps telling me that i cannot use the app, subject to review. I deleted the app and re-install, i would have use otget platforms but most of my contacts are here, they dont have tgis hitches I am experiencing."
1,What the hell you didn't given any source to reset end to end encryption password I didn't installed WhatsApp from last 5months coz I can't get my backup back which is very important to me.. this end to end encryption backup idea is just a waste... atleast you can make reset option there...
1,"Worst App ""When uploading video statuses from Android phones, the quality becomes significantly blurred. It's baffling how such a large company fails to provide its customers with a seamless app experience. You should consider exploring alternative platforms to share your status videos with your loved ones."""
1,I feel disccused to know that after having this app from inception I can't restore my data after I forget my password y'all need to change this feature even if an automated link is sent to the email registered to the account I would make using this app acceptable.
4,"Hi Team, Please have an update of hide & unhide chat it should be not shown if we search for hidden name. Lock option is good but if we lock specific chat & coming to normal chat list searching for locked person chat it was reflecting nane & open as normal it self I have tested locked person name should be not reflected. if we search for locked person name was refleecting. Please rollout new update regarding on this Thank you!"
1,"Dreadful client support system. If a person becomes victim of phishing the account gets blocked without any way to fix the issue. The system detects attacks too late and than punishes the victims. Deleting my business account on principle. Telegram is a much better messenger in any case. Screw you, meta!"
1,"This app is so annoying first of all they don't return their mails which is so frustrating which big corporation doesn't look at their mails,They aren't allowing my number to use What's app saying I am not using the official WhatsApp and I am direct from play store so so my experience while using this app has been the worst."
2,"i cannot send gifs. i search for the topic of a gif i want to send, i scroll and it completely resets and ignores what i searched‚Äì sending me back to the daily selection of gifs. it's tiring and frustrating."
2,"Switchover to new phone is an absolute nightmare. I've been trying to get it to work for 3 hours now. No luck. Facebook, meta, whatever, has made this app a complete joke."
2,I am changing my rating 5 to 2 reason is that new feature of channels of celebrity. Please give a option or setting to not to show up who don't want it. WhatsApp is quite personal thing making it typical social media is irritating so please consider this. Thank you.
3,Many times app stopped while using voice notes not record if recorded but going only empty note . App is updated why this issues comes with my device developers please solve this issue I cannot uninstall because since 4 years my data ll be erase
3,This video message facility is not available in my WhatsApp? Why? I have also updated. I have also tried reinstalling. But the video message facility is not available. Please take note.
5,"I would have rated 5 star but there is one Issue whenever you share a photo,video either to contacts or status the photos and video gets blurred at a huge amount. Please resolve this issue As soon as this issue is resolved i will rate it 5 star Edit: issue is resolved"
3,It's quite bad because I just reset my phone and redownload the app but has been having difficulty in receiving the verification code I need to wait over and over again for the timer to stop to request for the SMS or call yet it yield no result so please I need your help to complete my registration. Thanks
5,This is very good app. But I want to give a suggestion that there must be a setting that group members may not allow to view group info like one member can't see other member's mobile number and can't misuse it.
1,"Worst user interface in latest update. On touching emoji icon, entire screen moves up which is pathetic. Replying for a message also disturbed. If u drag a message for reply, it automatically opens keyboard on mbl, which was disturbed now in new update. Irritatingüò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨"
1,WhatsApp was a good app but nowadays it's not functioning well. Whenever I opens whatsapp everytime it shows to login again and when I register my no. It says that the no. Is restricted. And i have complained this more than 10 times but still there is no response. r
1,"Recently whenever I send an image or video in a chat, after clicking send I am kicked out of the chat and am on the contacts Page. As someone that uses images alot I find this rather frustrating."
3,Great chatting app but have a suggestion here. Could be made greater by enhancing the last seen options. One should be allowed to prevent specific people from seeing their last seen without blocking those people. It's going to be same on both sides but that will be cool.
1,"Was a good app untill their updates.each update has a bug whuch just gets worse.its like every phone you get ,no matter what it is,there is something wrong with something on whatsapp, honestly telegram performs better but WhatsApp has not only better qualities,but exciting and easy to use.except for the bug part which is annoying"
1,"Older version of whatsapp is better in ""storage & data"" menu, older version allowed to choose what we want to delete, for example you can delete text only or picture only or sticker only etc, now you can't do that anymore"
5,"Hi There must be the 'schedule your message' option as well. It's when want to send some message in future on odd times to someone, like reminders, there should be a facility there. It can save from miscommunication and delayed messages. Is it possible?"
3,Still lags behind Telegram in technology. And the new emoji drawer is rubbish. Incredibly buggy and doesn't provide an easier interface.
5,There must be a feature to upload high resolution photos in WhatsApp status(not talking about inbox) like they have launched the HD quality. There should be something similar for WhatsApp status also . The quality is very low.
2,"The whatsapp emoji section is laggy, buggy and the cursor doesn't show up in its search bar; please give an option to turn it off or switch it back, no one wants to use it."
3,"App is good but you can improve the quality of audio while recording it. I have tried through my video recorder and WhatsApp voice recorder, both have a major difference in quality, my video recorder records voice much clear than WhatsApp, so please fix it..."
5,"Received verification code without requesting it To protect your account, WhatsApp will send you a push notification when someone tries to register a WhatsApp account with your phone number. To keep your account safe, don't share your verification code with others. When you receive this notification, it means that someone has entered your phone number and requested the registration code. This often happens if another user mistyped your number when trying to enter their own number to register, an"
1,"With CONFIDENT I must say, META have ruined the legacy and charm of whatsApp by pushing into unwanted features which no one like me who like the simple chat and calling app... Now it's having channels features like telegram Why so much copying, WhatsApp was known for it's encrypted chats n calls which it lost when META TOOK over now channel feature is there which I think is not required.. Going to uninstall it soon"
1,"I have never give a bad review on whatsapp but literally you guys are giving trash updates. Please change back the emoji window layout to previous one. It's not at all user-friendly, time wasting and weird design. Please revert it back... Just giving 1 star to my favourite app so far cuz of this trash update, change it back then i will give 5"
1,All WhatsApp users are having scrolling issue.... I was thought... I only have this issue.... But after that I realised my friends circle also having this issue...... Once I Scroll my chat... Thats not working proper scroll.... It's jump to the before the yesterday chats..... So please re correct this issue.......
1,"Why is it that when using a Helmet Intercom, WhatsApp Call or Video can't be picked up automatically or the press of the Intercom is connected, sorry, it's not like Telegram or telephone calls via the GSM network. Hopefully in the future it can be... Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úÖüëç"
1,Videos cut short. Post a 30 second video to only have 10 seconds only able to be played. This has been happening since the last whatsapp update.
4,"Hi. After I transfer my data from my old phone to the new one, my new phone can't run Whatsapp at all. It always reflex ""Whatsapp runtime exception"" even though I've try many times reinstore Whatsapp and reboot my phone. How should I do?"
1,"My WhatsApp taking too much storage but actually I don't have that much of data in that, now my WhatsApp taking 6GB storage but i actually have only 2 GB of data, I don't know what the hell happened to WhatsApp please fix this bug üëæ, Thank you. It's still have 6GB of storage ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2,I don't like the new version. After updating to the new version my status/notification bar is on the lower side. I prefer to have it on top like it used to be initially. How do I change because I can't get the settings to change it
3,"storage space is less. Large file sharing is not possible. Even after the opt for keeping the messages, its been get deleted of the sender clears his memories.This is only concern. rest all are excellent. thank you"
1,"I m VERY much disappointed by this WhatsApp app. Since from 7 years ,i m using my personal number on WhatsApp suddenly what happened I don't know. From 3months I m facing too much problems. I m very much disappointed on WhatsApp, it's showing unofficially app where I downloaded it from playstore only ,and it's showing Account ban, sometimes OTP wil not recieve nor calling is done by whatapp for verification code.sometimes it askes review request. I m fed up of this. I can't change number also."
1,Login OTP code not coming. It keeps saying try after 1 hour. Its been one week. Worst support team ever which doesn't know how to support they are responding same information that they already have on their website. Worst development and management team. I suggest all to use alternative Meta services and Apps.
1,The voice notes need to desperately be fixed. Constantly changing between the voice speaker and audio speaker makes it almost impossible to listen to a voice note properly
4,Why does this app constantly modify or change my custom notifications. It's unreliable in that respect. I miss important notifications because I hear a different common tone to the one expected.
3,"If some one blocked me, i couldn't get any notification! Why? Why you people not fixing this!! Why you people not adding this feature?? This is so in vain maaan! Show this with the Time of blocking. Please, add this on it."
5,I updated the app a couple days ago and I got that video messages feature which kinda irritating to me coz after sending those msgs they automatically used to save in my gallery according to the date ....now they doesn't instead when I open WhatsApp to put anything on sts I see a folder there called 1970 and all those videob msgs are there...fix the bug please that's really disturbing
1,"Used to be able to search a particular contact's status. Now I have to scroll through all statuses to look for that contact. There's no order to the status updates. This is exhausting. Please, take us back to how it was. Thanks."
4,"This is such a great app for sending texts, very goodüòõ, but I have one issue, i can't find someone people that use WhatsApp in my contacts. That's why i gave it a four. The app is very good."
1,There is a bug recently that me and my friends are having that whatsapp stops responding as soon as we open it (online or offline) and it takes maybe a day or 2 for it to automatically fix but it's so annoying
2,"Video which are shared are not sending as per video quality and there is lag in audio and video, kindly resolve the issue. Thank you"
1,"Currently, the App crashes immediately when opening chats not used for longer than one week or chats with a changed contact number. Support dont give appropriate suggestions for solving this bug - very strange..."
1,"I am struggling with sending emojis lately. The moment i hit an emoji, the chat becomes plain, i wont even see how many emojis that i have selected. When i hit back thats when i see my entire chat with someone, now with a number of emojis that i didn't select willingly. Please assist."
5,Whatsapp is a very good social network but I want them to add show what you are listening to like when you are playing music with your phone people will see the title of the song just like the BBM app that shows the music you are listening to if the update will be added in the next whatsapp update I will be very grateful Thank you
5,I love this app!!üíò Did you know? WhatsApp can send as many photos as you want! And can send private messages / send messages to ourselves. We can upload photos and videos to our status! We can hide ContactsüòΩ And can mute our contact's status video üî• #I love WhatsApp Thank you for making this application WhatsApp üíòüí®
5,"Now i dont like the new status update, it makes it hard to view statuses, i have issues sliding to the side to view a status. Leave it how we can scroll up and down to view a status. Then other updates can be beside calls on another row....thanks."
2,No doubt it's a good app but when I updated it in August then setting of the app has become very bad whenever I open my chat or write something then the chat bar goes at the top of screen and it seems to be hang I request you to set that problem please
1,"Video call is not working properly on my WhatsApp and even if I make a video call, the voice is not working properly. Please fix it as soon as possible."
5,Better than texting as it can send gifs and emojis and the calling function is better than regular calling as you can add people to the call. All in all I would totally recommend this to smartphone users new and old
1,"Abeg abegg. For God sake.. Kindly make the latest update optional please. The status section should not have to change i beg. It is painful scrolling horizontally, it is horrible, please return the vertical s rolling mode, and make statuses visible and not dp. The latest update has serious user interface flops. I can't scroll statuses horizontally and horizontally and horizontally o er and over again. Haba!"
3,Its a very good app and very useful for my business.. The only thing is we are not able to broadcast message from whatsapp web. Its a request to team whatsapp to work out and activate this feature also so we can broadcast messages from whatsapp web also.
4,All good but there are two things i wanna say first is the quality of uploading photos and videos i mean whenever i upload any picture on status it gets blur its quality get deduct and secondly please include a new feature in whatsapp to dont allow the viewers to take screenshots of profiles and status without asking the owner please add it
1,"I don't understand this app at all. Each time I try to login my account it keeps saying, this WhatsApp is unofficial. I don't understand what's not happening. Kindly work on that. Otherwise it is getting out of hand."
2,"The new emoji and sticker interface sucks a lot. Bring back the old one, or at least stabilize this one. Not emerging, glitching out, even in Android 12 Pixel 3."
1,Latest update now my whatsapp keep crashing every time i tried to open it with internet connection. I can't receive any messages but i can send them and keep crashing.
5,"Am impressed with the recent upgrades in features of WhatsApp. However, I'll like to suggest you consider adding a privacy option to WhatsApp poll where only the person who initiated the poll can see the result. Thanks!"
5,"This app is good. But now i don't know what happened. Firstly, my WhatsApp was not able to send or receive messages and make calls. Then i reinstalled it. And now I'm trying to login my id after reinstallation, it asks to wait for 5 mins as whatsapp is not available. After 5 mins if i try it says the same thing again!! I seriously hate this glitch. Please help recovering this problem"
4,It's a amazing app... looking like a voice massage..any documents share and etc... This app is very helpful for any person who can conecting with their family for voice talking..video calling and everything shared data .. It's so nice app..
4,"Dear WhatsApp Team, As long-time users, we're grateful for WhatsApp's role in keeping us connected. We have a simple request: could you please increase the status update size to 10MB? This small change would let us share richer, more vivid moments with our loved ones, enhancing our connections and making WhatsApp even more valuable to us. Thank you for considering our request. Best regards, Judah Jerson"
3,"Please don't add unnecessary features like ""channels"".. WhatsApp is unique from all other social media..It created a special place in our Heart‚ù§Ô∏è...so don't try to loose your identity by adding these nonsense features which will distract the user.. Hope the WhatsApp team must notice this feedback Thankyou"
5,"This app is very good for chating and for buisness also, and this app has many other facilities, like video call, amazing emojis. I like this app too much. So clear quality. This most successful social media platform in the world. Thank you!"
5,It's the best app for sending messages and the is no trouble with it nothing bed happens to it. And it the best messages app for me and a lot of people use it I have not seen a messaging app better then this one and the video calls and the other calls a nice they is no reason when you should not get it app it the best messaging app I know and it never has problems to me and the is not adds on this
2,It's been a good experience until now. My day has been ruined thanks to Team WhatsApp for banning my account for no reason at all. I very sad about this. I have sent an email replying to your support and now let's hope for the best as the number which got banned had many important groups which are necessary for my upcoming exams. I hope the Team is trying to resolve it right now. If it doesn't get resolved then I'll switch to telegram or threads.
5,"Best way to keep in touch with family abroad! We often call & chat with our family and friends overseas. And thanks to this app, communication is impeccable. We're VERY grateful for this."
5,"It's super fantastic, easygoing. I like it ,it gives me the opportunity to communicate everywhere with minimum cost ,it's actually cost free sometime"
1,New update is working weirdly. The more icon next to status is gone which was helpful to see or delete stories. And videos are not uploading in stories.
3,It is a bit inconvenient to see the Starred message in the description. I want to say that when any message is starred in 1 TO 1/GROUP CHAT then that message can be shown at the top of the particular one to one chat or group chat display just like there is pin chat in your all chat list section. PLEASE ADD THIS FEATURE..
3,"It's ok but please let us remove the system messages, the ones that tell users who's been added, removed etc etc. I have to scroll past loads of them to reach the actual chat. It's ridiculous that we can't get rid of them."
2,I used to like this app more but they keep adding new stuff in that is not useful. I really don't like the new channels they have. They are kind of annoying and I haven't found a way to get rid of them. Overall I'm not real impressed
4,"Very good. There is a way to grouping conversations and groups? For example I would like to create a group (or section) called Work, and into I will have conversations and groups regarding my work. If possible it will be a great feature!"
4,Really dislike the new update. Why change a good thing if it works?? We got used to the emojis and could quickly navigate - but now it's just irritating.... Otherwise a good app.
4,"I am giving WhatsApp three stars because there is a problem in forwarding that takes a lot of time. It means forwarding messages consumes a significant amount of time, wasting valuable time."
1,I keep on getting banned for no reason. I'm following the terms and conditions and hardly ever text. I mainly use it for situational awareness among my friends. Support is not helpful in resolving my issue.
4,The app is very good but when searching for a person whom we want to call at call section it takes a lot of time to get that searched results Before doing update there is not any issues like that.
1,"This app is worst and worst! All the time when i talk the image block and after couples of seconds i see reconecting! Offcorse they need approve for the simple things, how in the world they spy us? No one believes what they say, it's encrypted ü§£ü§£ü§£"
4,"Hello, There are one bug on status seen people's list when there are many people who seen the status. The first person who see our status that not visible it half cut profile show."
1,Videocall does fail freaking often. Create a upgrade about this c'mon. I am unable to talk with my collegues and my girlfriend. It's ringing and when I open it's still ringing. After some time it fails. Please..
1,"This new update is awful, whey does the emoji tab take more than half the screen, and the even i press on an emoji it doesn't appear in the chat, i hope you fix these bugs, the usability of the app isn't pleasing at all"
1,"What is Channels? I can't join them, let alone looking for a ' Disable Channels ' option because honestly, this is a useless feature. Telegram has it already and making WhatsApp like this seems ridiculous. I'd rather have the old WhatsApp instead."
1,Uninstalling this only because there is no feature to share video on staths in HD Quality no HD Media option for android. Very low quality on status. No media HD Quality option found inside Storage and data option.
4,This is a wonderful app but I have problem in this new feature of updates in which the channels and the status bars are merged in the same pages.
4,"There some major features missing/not available like 1/- everyone option is in status privacy settings 2/- can't do live streaming through status 3/-very low limited size of data can send/receive üì≤ 4/- can't create @userID, 5/- can't create community"
3,"To answer an incoming call I have to open the app, tap on the displayed number then swipe up. By then the caller has given up. What happened to the answer buttons on the lock screen?"
2,"Known for invading privacy, incapable of providing backup on phone crash. Has been taken so called backup on g drive for past 3 years, which is no where to be found on restoration. Stupid spy app"
2,"Hi, before the updated all status sent can be reviewed from outside without clicking on it one by one. Did you get what is the thing I meant? My life is getting complicated üòÖ Please help to put back this option. Tq in advance"
5,It is very easy to use. Without whatsapp we cannot talk with foreign people. We can share screen on video conferencing. It is smart technology üëçüëç
1,Hello whatsApp? The worst app ever. No response from the customer support. Unable to login. Even using the official account. It show - you need the office whatsApp to use this account. I don't know why whatsapp is not responding to this problem
1,"Downloads loads of pictures to your phone. I know it can be turned off, but why it won't behave like messenger and by default? Annoying and useless, if I went to download a photo I can do it by hand!"
2,"My WhatsApp contacts don't sync with contacts on my phone during 2 last updates, and it's annoying because I had new contacts alot but their names don't appear in the list of chats, WhatsApp just show me their numbers."
3,"What happened to the 'edit message' feature... It's genuinely one the of the best things that's been made a feature. Please return it for the 5 star. Thank you, in adcance."
5,Better to add an option to create groups for status share option. It will be useful to create multiple groups and select that group while sharing status. It will be useful feature which we are waiting from looking time. Hope it will be roll out soon
3,"Why have you updated this app so badly? It worked flawlessly for so many years and it literally sucks now. It's slow, confusing and simply awful. The new keyboard, emojis jumping screen are disaster. Please do something."
4,Thanks WhatsApp for providing a great convenience with improving functions. It would be perfect if we could categorise the stickers/emoji saved!
1,"I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the customer service I recently received from WhatsApp. I have been a loyal user of your messaging platform for several years, but my recent experience has left me deeply disappointed. On August 2023, I encountered a problem with my WhatsApp ac"
4,"The app is lagging a lot, and it takes time while forwarding the message. idk why, but if anyone has an idea, let me know P.s I have the latest version of the app and have no storage issue"
1,"I can't see some of my friends profile picture, status & they can't also. It's really frustrating evn I uninstalled the app & downloaded it again but nothing helped, kindly solve this."
3,"Everything works fine but the reason behind 3 stars is no accuracy for backups and there is no scheduled messages function, i mean if we wanna wish someone on birthday then we need to wait till 12 am can't you add scheduled messages function..Take it as a request and solve these problems ASAP."
1,I have updated the apps and there is additional feature added as channel which is meaningless we've different apps for that kind of stuff . This app is all a mess trying to combine everything at one the original was much better . I hope developer know the actual purpose of WhatsApp
1,"Security is worse and whatsapp support is worst , my WhatsApp account got hack twice , and I want to deactivate my account and I emailed whatsapp support and the only thing Whatsapp does is some bot reply, that's all, the only thing Whatsapp does is end to endcryped chat and I'm not even getting any otp or calls so that I could log in , if I could rate it a negative star I wouldn't think twice."
1,"My account was suspended, and it was opened today, but anytime I want to login...it keeps saying ""you need official WhatsApp to use this account"". Even though I've updated the app, I keep seeing this error message."
4,"Can you bring a rewind and fast forward button to status videos? 30 secs video, yes it isn't too long but its also not very short."
1,"Worst , update again and again , previous version was good and easy this is not easy to use , icons shows below it's not look good , difficult to use."
1,Whatsapp crashes after every update and i have to remove it (including all the data) then reinstall it and redownload all the data. Only then it works and this keeps happening affer every update..
2,The updated version so annoying. Those channels are irritating and there isn't any setting to remove those channels.
1,"WhatsApp was perfect until you introduced channels on my status updates, I can't remove that thing it is obstructing the important statuses that I mus view I don't want to follow any famous channel I prefer WhatsApp to be my personal space the channels can they be for Facebook only I don't want any famous thing on my WhatsApp I want peace by interacting with people I know on a personal level. Please remove that Channel thing or give options some of us we don't want to see it."
1,"Horrible, it was amazing until one day I pressed WhatsApp and it came to a screen asking me to log in, I out my phone number in and then it asked for a code, I sent a SMS to myself like 10 times and I got nothing, I called myself 6 times but it wouldn't work I need what'sapp to communicate but I can't get in..."
5,"I'm rating you guys perfect 5 stars, I have a request, can you make cloud storage available on WhatsApp? instead of backing it to our Google drive or phone storage, something like what bandlab has, when storing your music."
1,The profile pictures next to messages look awful and annoying. The tiny images are unnecessary and an eye strain. Also why the annoying new layout for emojis and stickers? Awful!
1,Very frustrating. Keeps disconnecting. Video call keeps freezing after 13 hrs and 15 minutes. Many drop calls. Call time resets after 75 hrs.
1,"WhatsApp shows only numbers instead of Names..? Even after (1)App is updated, (2)contacts are synchronized. (3)All Permissions granted. Strange and quite inconvenience!!!"
2,"I have an issue, I have been banned for attempt login to the so called 'other unofficial versions of WhatsApp' I have tried to us my normal official version but it keeps saying am still banned despite uninstalling the other unofficial version and the help center keeps at that my account is working well and running yet I can't login to my chats"
1,"new update where statuses are now ""updates"" is terrible. Stop trying to be like insta and tiktok. I don't want instagram I just want a messaging app. Considering deleting Whatsapp and switching to my phone's built-in messager"
1,This app was famous because of its simple UI for chatting. Now Meta has made into Instagram after adding channel feature. Give us an option to disable all these new features!!!
2,"We cannot see the high quality video, photos. And we cannot able to edit video in status for background music and only music from folder"
1,I can't seem to get a verification code on my new WhatsApp. Its beginning to get annoying. I can't get stuck with a phone simply because u people refuse me a verification code for my new phone.
1,"after the latest update, when i try to input some emoji, the text box is dissapearing onto the back of the emoji layer, so disgusting, happens with every single update which is always unnecessary feature sucks!"
1,"opened ticket with the whatsapp support, got 2 ts steps that you can find them in Google search but they didn't solved the problem ticket and was closed without resolution. 23.8 issue persist with double images and all I got from the support is a loop of the same ts...02.09 another ticket opened as today 200 images where downloaded again"
1,Well these new updates i am done being WhatsApp usse.who needs channel and all dump my friends status in deep hell. Showing all sorta promotional channels and basically forgetting basic premise of WhatsApp .. I am done being your user. You can keep throwing this garbage app in front of users majority gonna uninstall this . As it's not usable at all.
1,"I keep downloading the app but everytime I try to use it stops, requesting me to use the official app. I haven't texted or received a text from anyone for several days. It's a zero star for me. What's wrong with the app???"
1,Very dissapointing update.. Very very uncomfortable with the app... Please change it to the previous system... It's so ridiculous.. What is the need of making a communication app such a big thing... It was all good when it was all simple ... Please change it
5,Overall good but add a login with email otp option coz i dont recharge my sim tht often so i lose getting incoming sms ... If possible this login with email otp feature is convenient as i use this feature in telegram and about section should hav ability to add clickable bio links like in discord
5,good experience its good I like it myy Mobil is very much like a big deal to us but we don't know 6that a thing to say but it was just like that one time a year and then it just seems that it has been the best thing I've ever had but i still love with my friends in a lot and i'm so excited about the future i think it's going on for a couple reasons but i'm sure you will have the opportunity for the first one of my time and the rest will not make any difference for you in a way i can help w
5,Oh God!So nice. This app is very useful for students. Generally all official school groups are made in this app. It is so simple to use.I want to give big thanks to developers.. New features of channels are too good. We can stay updated through it. Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è developers..
4,I am facing a issue particularly in my device poco f1 and partially in WhatsApp that sometimes or i say most of the times when messages came the message goes under the keyboard and also the emojis go up in the top and there is huge gap in cat inbetween keyboard and emojis ... It Occurs after the new update ... When what's app rmoji key board changes
2,"People take it like family member but a feature(find channels) not good for rural area's family ....whatsapp thik like other app(instagram,youtube) that people expend more time on it . It is good for younger(according to you) ..but not for ..! So kindly i request you to change it.."
3,"Latest update is soo bad , all the archived chat keep popping up every time a message sent also group notification and sound keep turned on by itself. I hope you fix the problems"
1,Whats app..Can you remove the stupid channel option from whatsapp or atleast have the option to deactivate it completely. It's really annoying to see these stupid channels popping up on status which hides actual status from my friends and family
3,I wish that WhatsApp would put the futures from the laptop app on the phone one. And WE NEED : temporary grups with timers when they delet Also now with the new updated I can't use my stickers. And I HAVE A LOT OF THEM. It's annoying because I made them and I can't use it. Please do something. And I still want a temporary grup chat üò´ü§å
1,"So much glitches, time does not get updated. 1 minute ago remains 1 minute agp for hours till I restart the app. Recent call are not visible unless I restart the app These are some problems which I face my device is of samsung and I had the same issues even in my previous device ."
5,"Hello support, my whatsapp is not working. Im not receiving any messages or calls from any number. When i send message it reaches the person but for me its still single tick. When they sending reply to me not delivering to me. But i can see them online or last online status. After that i updated the whatsapp also."
1,"The latest version still has laggy stickers and emojis, the layout is not as comfortable as the old version, switching between emojis and stickers is now very unpleasant."
2,Deleting the app. There's no point to have it since it does not give u an alternate phone number. I wanted an app that would give me a phone number that I can use as a second line. Or possibly a screen name instead of a number for people who also use the app. I don't have a use for the app so I don't want to have it on my phone.
1,"New updates are always bad! Like the ""community"", then changing the interface of sticker/emoji section, and now this ""channel"" I just hate to drop down everytime to see someone's story! Please undo it Whatsapp."
1,"The recent update is really such a worst thing.. The channels section in status tab is fully irritating me, and that channel section automatically hiding the status of my contacts."
4,It's pretty on some things I personally don't care for the phonei guess that's it I did not realize he could talk text on this thing that's a very good option very good if I don't always fill up to texting everything you want to say
2,"I am not happy with the photo quality once you upload a photo/video on WhatsApp.The app also plays status videos even after exiting the app,it's frustrating.üëéüèΩ"
1,Whatsapp blocked all my numbers what's wrong and have been trying to logins both my numbers but wasn't permitted... Kindly please help me with it and open the account for me because it's very important to me and to my student's.. it's the same account have been using over some years back and it really saddened my heart haven't been okay with such the way you blocked the account on WhatsApp Two numbers of mine was blocked in same day and don't have access to registered it again on WhatsApp.....
2,"It's used to be a good app but this new channel features is really frustrating why should you forced a feature that you do not want or need , atleast give any option to Disable."
1,I am not a able to use WhatsApp for more than a week. First I had problem loginng in with PIN which I had never set for my account and had to wait for 7day first then again for 5 days..now again I was logged ou automatically and I am not getting OTP to log in my account. Very disappointed üòî
4,"Dear Team Whatsapp, whatsapp is not showing the ""My contacts except"" feature in ""last seen, profile photo, about"" please solve this problem as soon as possible. Its a humble request to you Thank you"
2,"I know its a small thing but its getting on my nerves for real , when i swap right to reply to a specifec massege the keyboard won't pop up automatically as usually so i have to click on the massege bar below to continue the convo ... Get it back please"
1,"This new update is so buggy, especially when typing a message and the text box doesn't expand so you can't see what you're typing."
1,I'm using offical whats app which i have downloaded from google play store im getting error ( you need an offical whats app to use this account ) im not using any third party app still im getting error i've also contact to whats app support via email but my issue is not resolve i've also changed the device and im getting same error
3,"I love WhatsApp, especially the new update,where you can send videos to someone in HD .If you can also apply that feature on WhatsApp status this app would be perfect..the graphics on status is really bad. please fix this"
5,"Happens after the latest update.. Previously when I used to delete a message from a chat, whatsapp automatically use to resort the chat list according to date. but now when I delete a message, it does not change the chat list by date.."
1,"Since the last update (September 2023), the app can't send media. It always says ""can't send this media. Choose a different media""."
2,Hate the new channels part of whatsapp. I wish whatsapp could separate it from statuses completely. They need to make a small section for it next to calls the same way they made a small section for community next to chats i think that will work way better or they should put channels with community. Its really bothering me!
1,"Worst app, because 2mb or 3mb image take more than 4 or 5 minutes for sending and after also go to loding.... Archived messeg need in botam said not top said ü§ëü§Æü§¢ after sending image quality gose HD to 144 or 250 pp its big problam of this app. üë∫"
4,All perfect but just increase this things:- 1)The status timing because just 30sec it's not enough sometimes. 2) video call quality it's even not looking natural skin colour. Next time these important updates I really want & even all WhatsApp user want these in WhatsApp.
1,"Big Issue- Whenever I clicked on Any message or pick or chats for delete it from WhatsApp. Delete button at top header section seems disabled.But actually It is in Active mode. so when we click on any file or mag for select, Delete button should be in active state.bot in deactivate."
4,I think it's a verry worst update in it. Due to it's give us many destruction. We are a average student. Newly Newly featured are affected us. So kindly request to WhatsaApp developer to minimize it. And another version for studentüë©‚Äçüéì
3,"Please, the interface where the status lies is just too busy! Too many things on one screen.... The previous version seems to be better"
5,"Hi, I have a suggestion Please to add another option in WhatsApp. Those Namburs are not registered in Our Mobile , they are not able to directly massage in our WhatsApp and Please create a massage request system, or make the Sepmm to come up with unknown messages, and if we see the message, the opposite side not understanding that we saw the message, like Messenger."
1,"Using emojis and is very difficult in the updated version. Day by day whatsapp is getting difficult to use. And another point is occupying more space i.e 880Mb , its occupying more space compared to all other apps in my device."
5,"This app is one of my favorite app, frequently I use it, I have a suggestion: If I want to see status of any one person then next user's status starts by itself so there should be option in this page just like ask to user that they want to see all user's status or only single one means give option to user to choose the option then app take action according to user choice."
1,Its becoming a social media app with channels etc.. Used to be clean and simple! No one wants to see channels in their personal messenger. No option to hide them either
2,Whatsapp is really good. I just dont like the new emoji and sticker keyboard. It is a pain to use. I preferred the way it used to be. Wold like it to be changed üòÖ
2,"A good messaging app, but please make sure to save your important documents in device memory asap received through WhatsApp. This app is not reliable about restoring your backup on new device as It doesn't show you email ID which was linked for backup on your previous device."
4,"It's okay, functional and everything but, I wish I was able to pin a message in a chat. It would be super beneficial honestly."
1,Stop making updates I liked the app for what it was. This doesn't need to be Facebook. Please remove the channels it's very frustrating. Or make it possible to mute it hide it.
1,"Whenever I receive pictures on whatsapp, they have poor quality, or even if I send pictures to the next person, the quality is poor. Same as posting it on status."
1,Still complaining about the way whatsapp status are so blurry really frustrating had to even switch to gb which was far better I heard there was an hd i came back but later on i found out it was removed like whyyy?? The fact thst u guy don't do any thing abt this is so annoying Like y would u reduce pictures quality it wasn't like this before is like the update get worst every single day
4,"Very good app, but I would like if it stopped changing all the time. There is no need for the channel tab!!!"
5,"The app is amazing and all, but if you could the ability to pin messages on group chat (especially by admins), that would be great.üëçüèø"
2,"My WhatsApp has been uninstall than i reinstalled WhatsApp and backed up my old chats but my old media is not showing in my gallery? And in WhatsApp it is showing restoring media, from past 2 days but still in progress... i unable to view my old media documents video's etc etc..."
1,"Whatsapp team is deactivated my account without any reason. Whatsapp team members are using my account as I have Uninstalled Whatsapp, it's showing online to my family members. Kindly delete my account as my account is hacked and someone is using my account. My profile picture is not mine photo. I am not able re-activate my account. I have complained so many times but no support from Whatsapp team. Users be careful, it's may happen to you also"
1,"Idk is there's only who is facing the problem that after closing the application it still shows online to others, ur team should work on it,It is creating a mess nd many misunderstandings."
1,The new update makes whatsapp more distracting than ever. This phsycological play done by its creators will led to a more messed up world where in lust will be the only moto for life .Cause when i opened the channels i saw channels of women posing wrongly.whatsapp if it want to stay in the market it should not try to become like insta. Now i prefer using signal
1,This app is wrost app. the safety and privacy are not acceptable. My account was restricte but I Don't know what happened with my account. Please find bugs and fixed them as possible as.
1,"I hate the"" channel "" update, it's unnecessary. WhatsApp is supposed to be a private message app , but now it feels more like ""social"" media. Please look after this update and remove it"
1,"Now you have added now feature called channels can you pls keep it in new tab not in the status tab. It was disturbing. Or we dont want that feature. We want whatsapp only for our personal things. Don't make it like facebook, instagram. Pls WhatsApp is only for personal use not for following celebrities üòíüòí. Please change that üôèüôèüôèüôè. Otherwise there will be an alternative for whatsapp too üò§"
1,Recent update/features are nonsense. And there are no options to disable channels and remove the feature completely.
4,"Does not inform the user whenever an update is required,you will find out through wasted data i.e in form of downloading a document till 99% only to see it restart. And too many useless updates"
3,Good performance and excellent features! Only if you can make the HD option to be a default.
1,"WhatsApp is not working good , not functioning appropriately, from last 2 to 4 weeks I'm not able to download status , even some medias files etc in chats groups...please remove all this errors as fast as possible ."
1,"Ive always used it and its good, after being offline foe some time, i get and it doesn't work perfectly like it ways did, i uninstalled and installed again and now i cannot recieve an sms verification code, all i'm told is to wait for one hour so please i really need help"
4,"World largest connect application is WhatsApp so I want one more suggestions for will make more good application in the entire world in payment system suggestions is ""make touch botton to direct payment button with currency logo beside user name shown while group message recieved in group then anyone can directly touch currency pay button to user and directly send payment or money to whom want to send."
2,"The recent updates, September 2023. While app doesn't crash. Textbox and the emoticons have somehow separated when selected."
1,My what's app account has been blocked and I don't know the reason. Can I get back my what's app no. activated again? or what should be the procedure to activate. As I have important contacts to get in touch with. kindly look into this matter.
3,I loved the old WhatsApp where there was no following list what what but now it's irritating and so confusing I don't want it there !!!!!!! But overall it's a great communication app
1,"Channels feature. I really HATE it. Please delete that feature, WhatsApp.. And please give us the old version of status feature. And upgrade it a little bit not downgrade it. It's stressing me out.."
1,"The new channels update is worse, even if I don't want it, I am not able to remove this. Whatsapp at least should give give a option that if you want it, you can have and if not then you can remove it"
1,it keeps asking to enter a pin for 2FA after downloading on new sim. After clicking forgot pin it sends an email which you will never receive. I'm still waiting for that pin reset email and i have only one email account.
1,So many updates.. But still not able to move storage to SD card. Secondly cannot copy images and videos from group or participant to external storage... üò≠ URL no Snapcsot.. Time to switch...meta scks üòî
3,The app is really great but the emojis on the android are awful can u please make them the same as the ios emojis And can u please make the video posting for statuses the same as the Instagram because it's really annoying having to trim the video and trying to make the next part of the video perfect Please do it on the next update
5,"Whatsapp must create a new feature, the feature is create a folder in the chat menu. This folder can be a customize by the user [ rename or delete ]. When a normal chat or a group selected by the user, in the option menu have a function to move the selected chat [ normal or group ] into the created folder by the user. So i think we have a structured folder with a folder name similar with a default archive. Thank You"
5,"I love whatsapp so much I love everything about whatsapp but I would love whatsapp to include music and video player for the caller and receiver to be able to play, watch, listen to one music and watch a video together through the WhatsApp or whatsapp calls. I've always wished to play music for my lover during whatsapp calls. I wish whatsapp can add this for us. Thanks."
3,Hello whatapp I have been using whatsapp for a very long time and now am not allowed to use it anymore I don't understand why. and have not violated any rules. I will be greatful if it is resolved as it is affecting my communication with friends. Looking forward to hearing from you.
1,"All my chats got erased even after having backuo to my email. Using for years, but now after their newest update - Adding Groups option. It's worst. All my images, media, chats everything got deleted. And only WhatsApp groups are available but with no chats. Worst...worst..... worst"
1,"Ridiculous!!!!!! Bring back previous version of chat emoji, sticker,gifs options panel from bottom.... It's very uncomfortable to use. Bring back the old version of chat option panel of emoji, sticker, gifs.."
1,My WhatsApp account is hacked. And whatsapp can't do a thing. Can't even detect the sim card number from the device. What kind of a useless massanger app is this and it's support group is top notch in disappointment. If WhatsApp can't handle it's business then it's better that they shut down. Whatsapp security is just a myth.
2,"I HATE the new actualization. I don't like to tap stickers and see the ones for defaults, I want mines, and besides that I hate gif searching I just can't understand why this change so arbitrary and weird because it doesn't improve anything in searching is just a waste of time. Ugh üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª"
3,"Is WhatsApp working on providing a close/cancel option on ""Channel"" section, for users who would like to keep their WhatsApp limited to only chats/messages and not transition it into Instagram 2.0..??"
5,Absolutely love ‚ù§Ô∏è üòç this App! What's App is amazing! You can upload up to 30 pictures at a time. And a lot of videos too! I take so many pictures and What's App makes it so much easier to share! Thank you so much!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòçü§ó
1,Recent update makes it somewhat hard to navigate statuses. It would be so much better if the channels had their own tab.
2,"What's up with this new updates feature? Can't FB quit tampering with a successful app and let it be what it was originally meant to be. A private messenger app? Sorry but please remove this ""new"" feature."
1,Before this all the video or photo that I send to people or I put status it will save in phone gallery so I easy send people and one more thing I can share my status to ig story but now that futures all not available I'm very disappointed and the emoji function all hard to use day by day I'm hating this app
2,"Please bring back search option for status and list format for status The story format is not it at all We already have IG and Facebook for that Ever since I've updated it, I find it hard to view statuses. Please do something about this"
1,"This New update sucksü§¶, the aspect of status you can't search for a contact status to view anymore, you'll have to scroll down to wherever it is, and i have 3.5k+ contact on my WhatsApp, to be sincere the old version is better than this"
1,"I have a very latest version of this app , But the main thing is, I can't see ""Chat lock"" option in anywhere.. Specially in my device / registered mobile no. Request to you WhatsApp team kindly provide me the all of common WhatsApp features like others have....."
1,Everything that you don't want to happen is happening terrible videocalling voice calling sound and picture distorted. Incorrect info on call list just everything letting me down
1,The latest update is the worst thing that could've happened to whatsapp. All those channels are very annoying and were completely unnecessary.
1,When I downloaded the app it was working fine I put my chat in archived and locked chats but then when i wanted to open the locked chats it stopped to open even I had fingerprint in my whatsapp and even when I want whatsapp web I press on linked devices it happens but when I press on QR code it doesn't open . Please work on the problem in the app
1,Its been ages my whatsapp has not neen updated. I cant even find proper location feeding. The places i had been to are not even found on this app. No update for music till now. Am just forced to used this for work purposes
1,Very worst... You guys are showing me irrelevant people to follow.. I dont want to them to follow on wp. I dont like publicity.. Actresses.. There should be a choice for any individual if they really want that updation. Just forcing to follow the new update version which is just non sense.
4,"Add more features, please. Such as auto reply (not only for Business), scheduled message, more privacy settings (hide view status without turning off read receipts, etc), and new custom theme!"
3,"With the new update of Channels, any media downloaded through any channel isn't visible in gallery or as a chat in storage management. Only way to delete it is delete the message completely with delete it in device gallery checked."
5,"Could you make a feature, where your able to record your status and save them as a reel, for later use. With the caption too."
1,"The new sticker interface is STUPID. It was fine before, there was no need to change it. Why go out of your way to fix things that were never broken and make it worse? PUT IT BACK."
5,"This was my favorite message app. It was easy to use and efficient, the app is pretty stable. Also absolutely awesome.,,, THANK A LOT ,YOU'RE THE BEST FOR ME AND THEM."
1,"There's a bug on story, it keep cut the video to 15sec. (the video is actually more than 30sec, but somehow it's not cut the video to 30sec but cut it into 15sec instead, fix it please"
1,It's automatically logged out of my mobile and while trying to login it's show guessed to Many times please try after 2hours and now while trying after 2hours it's show again same but now it's saying try after 12 hours and I didn't ha any linked devices. What should I do now to get my WhatsApp back
1,"I'm getting an error as : ""something went wrong to your chat history, restore it now"". And after restoring it, most of my chat history got lost. This is very disappointing by WhatsApp."
1,What happen to voice chat on this app? Please fix it. The voice chat is not really work well sometimes the voice chat can be use and sometimes it does not make any sound after recorded the voice chat. Please fix this failure as soon as possible.
4,I am unable to install the app even after trying for more than 10 times. I uninstalled due to some issue and now I am not able to reinstall it . Please work on my issue as early as possible.
1,Even after repeated complaints of the users you still can't fix the upload quality issue. Seems like you don't want people to use WhatsApp as social media app but just as a texting application. Pathetic!!
1,I don't know why but after I reached home from outside my WhatsApp is showing that my account is not allowed to use WhatsApp... I don't get the issue... This bug came suddenly on my WhatsApp.. And also I had an important meeting today in WhatsApp... I request the team to please help me as soon as possible
3,"I like this app but now I have a issue whenever I upload a status , it's upload in a compressed form. The quality is so low I can't upload any status."
1,"Please stay as OG and not be a copy cat of Telegram. WhatsApp used to be simple, now with this new find channels in update section ruined the look and feel of whatsapp. Not happy with the update and new unwanted copied feature of Telegram."
1,very bad experience. i have used WhatsApp within last 7 years. bt now watsapp not working properly. like a watsapp account was hacked. but company was not responding for that...... in watsapp account not showing any linked device so how can another person can used my watsapp account... pls give me realiable answer.....
1,Please remove all the groups you have given to follow because it does not feel personal and safe. It feels like public social media like Instagram or Facebook. Please remove those updates. It doesn't feel like end to end encrypted.
1,"Now the worst update is here . I personally hate these type of features like reels , post etc all these kind features are in Facebook and Instagram that is why I quit them now I think it's time to quit whatsapp because of *update feature."
1,The channel feature is not good. It has just made more difficult for users to access status. I'm very much disappointed with this feature
1,"Any joker can add you to any group , it's very very disturbing, they are adding all old people to groups who don't have proficiency using electronic devices Request WhatsApp to change this Adding to group should not be possible without permission Only a link should be sent And warning should be provided that you are joining a group"
1,"You are making your customers more vulnerable to frauds by adding screen share option. WhatsApp is a chat application, so requesting you to keep it simple and stick to the idea of being a chat application only."
5,This app is just getting better and better. The coolest features have been rolled out in the past month or two. Love love loves the video notes!!
3,Good apps. But to make is best WhatsApp have to provide Language Translate post option (Hindi post to English etc) like X apps have it. Where if user got message in hindi then by just one click user will able to translate to English.
4,Kindly add chat filters like in the facebook app.... from which we can go to any desired date in the past to read a chat without scrolling through fingers upward for a long time which is really exhausting...
1,"When sharing videos in WhatsApp status, it's not clear than before.please be kind to give better service for clear videos.ü•∫Other options are excellent. Thank you..."
3,"I like WhatsApp messenger so much but for a while now I have been experiencing something different,it is now very difficult to upload a status it sometimes takes 48 hours to upload unlike before, please work on it cause it's annoying"
2,Somehow I can only send vids 10sec long and when I tried to send a 30sec vids it automatically cut to 10 seconds Idk what causes it. But yeah thats the problem.
1,"the new updates were unnecessary and made the app harder to use,that new keyboard design for emojis,gifs and stickers is the worstttt. its so unpractical, plz bring the old design back."
1,"Ruined the entire app by changing how the emojis are laid out. It was so much better before and this is just annoying, unnecessary and honestly just more messy."
2,Remove the channel feature. The channel feature is make me irritate üòñ. And. After seeing status. Status is automatically hide. this is also make me irritate üòñ
2,"I give it 2 stars because , back up option is not working since last update,it doesn't show the progress on status bar , just states please wait a moment, please do something on back up option please"
5,"Whatsapp has become part of our life.. very easy to use. Guys suggest - 1. To introduce Porn Filter, can I auto delete porn videos sent in groups, start marking them appropriately. 2. Auto delete feature where chats in groups can be opted to auto delete daily, weekly or fortnightly or monthly. 3. Auto block message from few of the people in group, please make it possible, if I don't want to see msg from few people but want to be part of group. 4. Group Admin could restrict forward or Copy of msg"
1,"i just installed it, registered and did not violate anything then after couple of hours it says my account is not allowed to use this app. Supposed to be I will be using it only for work then that happened in just few hours."
3,It's a good messaging app and great feature of HD images üëå when sending all that is left is for status and profile picture to stay on HD.
1,"Whatsapp is a no doubt a good platform but recently i am getting some errors while using wp. The chat lock option is not being shown in my app,and i cannot use its features. Please cheak the addressed problem."
1,This whatsapp feature of following channels is not convenient to me. It's boring.. It make difficulty to view my muted statuses. It also make not convenient on normally viewing my statuses before of update.
1,Pathetic experience. I am unable to receive verification code to login into my A/C I tried several times although my number is active I can receive all other otp except for WhatsApp on my number I tried using other number too and got the otp there but not on my previous number I have sent mails to WhatsApp support team but in revert got a bot message guiding me the steps which I have already tried several times. It's my humble request to WhatsApp team to kindly fix the issue at the earliest po..
1,"Awfull when old phone was stolen - it constany asks to confirm sing-in on old phone, but i have no access as it was stolen. Confirmation screen must have option to change verification by one click"
5,It's great but I think you have to add a feature. If you lock the chats and they are hide the lock chats status will also hide from the status privacy.
1,I'm so much disappointed because this update WhatsApp channel feature I'm can't disable it. Can't you add this feature disable or enable option. It's too much now please add or remove you chose anyone.üòêüòêüòê
1,I recently uninstalled because of some issues and tried to reinstall the app but couldn't sign in to my account. I even tried using a new number but couldn't do so. What is wrong with whatsapp?
4,"Love whatsapp but just a request... Please increase the pinned chats number from 3 to like at least 5-6. It'll be really beneficial for professionals. Also, please work on ""scheduled messages"" option. It'll be transformational. Please look into it"
3,Works well but I hate the new status display page as well as the emoji tray. It makes my phone feel laggy and looks absolutely atrocious.
1,The worst update ever of following the channels.... Please remove that ... It's seriously pathetic .... Are you on your way to make it more like Facebook..... Definitely didn't like that. PLEASE REMOVE THIS UPDATE OF FOLLOWING CHANNELS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.!!!!
1,"Please remove nonsense channel follow options from status as soon as possible. Do not roll this feature, whoever want to search any channel will search and follow. That's why most people love Goggle for its simplicity."
1,Impossible to transfer to a new phone without issues. It is most unfortunate that WhatsApp is necessary because it is the main means of communication for most people.
2,Bug detection:- Is there a bug like one person left the group and didn't show in beta version but it's shows on regular version in my friends phone . Please notice my message
2,"so for WhatsApp is going good but I found some problem with new update that the previous emoji settings in this WhatsApp was easy, now I feel little bit difficulty while selecting emoji so it would be better if you change emoji setting again to previous one thanks!"
5,"It's a good app for privacy! They don't monitor your conversations or record it, it's scrambled so no one can detect it."
1,"Can u have an option that will automatically add new contacts into my ""disallow"" list of people to view my profile stuffs such as display pic, status etc? Very troublesome for me to keep doing that for all new contacts, thank you!"
1,"I prefer the emoji layout of a few months ago. And I absolutely HATE the American order of date setting (month FIRST, then day and then year.) It SHOULD BE: Day/month/year OR Year/month/day."
4,Decent experience. Hopefully the developer added the schedule for delete the entire chat. It could benefits a lot of users and also time!
1,"This app have a lot of bugs for dates. I have a different date and time every day one day 2015, one day 2007 and one day 1997! It makes chatting hard cuz Idk when my friend has sent her message to me and my mobile's date and clock is ok!üò¨"
1,I'm not able to log in to my account.When I'm logging in it shows I'm using unofficial version but when I click to download official version it shows the one I have already downloaded.please fix this issue.I have tried many times but it seems like it is not working . I request you to please fix this issue as soon as possible. How come I'm using unofficial version if this is the one I'm using On its been three week but they did not fix it yet
1,WhatsApp refuse open asking me to install official WhatsApp. I have uninstalled thrice and reinstalled but I keep getting the same pop up. WhatsApp fix this issue because my WhatsApp has been hacked for four time concurrently and I am trying to recover my account.
1,"I'm so much disappointed from this new update having public channels like other social media. Such an unnecessary update no one wants in WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a private messanger I don't think people want to use this app to socialize as Facebook or Instagram. It's just a simple messaging app , stop bothering the privacy we want."
2,The new update is very bad. Even on WhatsApp we don't want to follow other people. Let it be just like a texting app don't turn it into another Instagram or Facebook. Very dissatisfied with the new update.
1,It takes lot of time to send codes and increases time limits by a single click. What a ridiculous application I have ever used.
4,I think there should be an option. Where we can pin any message or poll in the group chat so that it always shows at the top. Until all the members of that group see the message or the poll.
2,"Unable to go exact Date of chat, a feature that would allow us to go the specific date of a person's chat would be helpful, as it is currently quite difficult and requires dragging to discover the date chat."
1,After last update Messages didn't appear at the time Its appear late - can be hour late or just when im getting inside the app so then they come :/ With the emoji its more hard to find them and not easy.
4,"Very reserve experience. my contacts names don't appear on my WhatsApp app. Only numbers I see, and is not helping me. Many of my contacts also disappear from the app. Kindly help"
3,What kind of update is this ? I can't even able to see the muted status in my WhatsApp after this rubbish update and I don't what this channels please provide some options that we choose to remove them.
4,"This is app is convenient and all but merging the updates and status screens does not make the app any easier to use, please separate those two items into tabs as well"
3,The latest beta version keeps stopping. It doesn't work. Kindly resolve the issue as soon as possible. Cannot text to view messages from my mobile.
1,This is annoying ever since I used Huawei p8 lite 2017 my whatsapp number I getting blocked each and every time even if am not using.. I tried using different number since I though my number got problem guess what same story over n over again.. I have been sending countless emails on whatsapp support official they will assist only for that short time to access my WhatsApp then blocked it again what's that?
5,"It's great, I wish I could update status with videos and they go to my Facebook profile same time, same time. They listened so I'm giving them an extra start!"
5,Very nice app...in all messenging apps...bt there is no option to off active status...when we r online. Sometimes we don't want to see other ppl that we r active ...bt unluckily no option ...so we r having to show.
1,"When you post on status, it's blurry as in very bad quality and they removed the option of improving the quality in the settings. Please fix this because it's really annoying"
2,Messaging yourself to remind yourself of something is great but it doesn't help when your own chat it's pushed down by other messages and that your only allowed to pin 3 chats. I have to go looking for my name to see what I wrote myself.
2,The search option for statuses has disappeared. I can no longer search for individual contact statuses if they're uploaded or not.
1,Not getting messages until I go in the actual app. This is after purchasing a new phone. Ensured all the settings are correct.
1,Unnecessary intrusion of different channel recommendations to follow in our private place of status updates. Pl atleast let there be an option for those who don't like it to remove it from there so that we don't get to see it Thanks
5,"Overall experience is good. I just request that, when we are posting our images on status the quality goes down. Could you please fix this?"
4,"Latest version update is not satisfactorily satisfy me. In the status section addition of channel, also the removal of find symbol in status is not worth to the app. Instead previous version was better."
1,The reason why WhatsApp users use other whatsapps is because it has setting like it show when your contacts are online and also others like themes to beautify your WhatsApp and many more. So i think you guys should consider bringing them in to help them use the original one THANK YOU.
1,"Man please remove ""update"" and bring back ""status"". Or make separate section for ""update"". I know you are using our muscle memory to promote your channel and all but still. Make a difference section."
5,"I think whatsApp is the best app for chatting with everyone it is also secure , free calls across the world and multi features . This app is fantastic. I love this app is so interesting and informative . So, that's why I give this app five stars"
2,"i hate it veryy much how they changed the emojii bar with the sticker and gif bar!!üò°üò°üò° it was perfect the wayy it was with the emojii catergories ontop and the gif and sticker at the bottom, now I'm pressing the flag emojiis instead of backspace!!! i hate it!! and what's with this channels thing now..??"
3,"I loved using What's App, but this new update with channels... I am not feeling it. I don't even want to see the option. How do I remove that section completely? And no, I am not following any channel."
3,"2 star less just because it glitches out every time i select the ""show my last seen to my contacts except"" option and shows my last seen visible to everyone. Such a turn down!"
3,"I Can't open document files automatically even though I already have a document opening application, Google Documents, Office 365, PDF Reader. Really hope there is a solution to this."
5,The app works so great. One feature i admire is the security especially the two step verification keeps my account safe and secure from been scam. Bravo to the administrator.
1,We don't like the latest update on WhatsApp which includes Channels .Do remove it we not at all like it.Only default is that we cannot upload high quality pictures and videos üòî Hope this will be set soon..
3,"Everything is fine but why the hell does this app needs 40gb‚ÅâÔ∏è I don't even use this app a so much now. Neither do I text anyone often, neither nor do I make calls and in fact I don't even have any large files, I just have 205.5 MB!!! IT'S IN MB!!! But this app needs 40 GB!?"
1,"The emoji update is really sucks! Can WhastApp don't introduce useless thing? It was way better before without al those stupid avatar emoji! And after the update there comes a lot of bugs! Looks really sucks, gonna change apps and use other apps instead... what a DISAPPOINTMENT..."
1,"AT THE MOMENT WHATSAPP DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR RATING. THE LATEST UPDATE IS A TOTAL VIOLATION OF PRIVACY WITH THE CHANNEL SETUPS. PLEASE REMOVE THIS YOU KNOW WHAT!!!! THERE ARE ENOUGH FEEDS ON FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, YOUTUBE, TIKTOK AND WHATEVER ELSE. GIVE YOUR PROGRAMMERS WORK THAT MAKES THE APP MORE FUNCTIONAL AND DON'T FORCE SOCIAL MEDIA RUBBISH INTO AN APP FOR COMMUNICATION!!!!!!"
2,The channels update An update that one does not want to use and has no interest in seeing it at all. One cannot change it or delete it.
1,"This new update sucks, why do we need to follow people on WhatsApp now. Isn't it enough we do it on Facebook and Instagram that now something that is supposed to be intimate for friends and family has turned into yet another boring obnoxious social media platform for marketing purposes. Very disappointing"
5,"I have had a positive experience with WhatsApp. It is a free, easy-to-use, and secure messaging app that I can use to stay in touch with friends and family all over the world. It is free and easy to use. There are no subscription fees or hidden charges"
1,I keep getting flagged accidentally everyday. Very inconvenient and unreliable app. Of there were a zero star I would have preferred it for this app. Fix your problems to avoid stressing users.
1,"since last update i cant scroll down anymore in the gif section, only when i tab the gif button and see the standard gifs pop up screen i can scroll but after try to type in the apps gif searchbox its glitching out and the gifs im searching are gone ....please fix this!! thnx"
4,"Sound is not working during screen sharing of video . Please add thie feature, It's not a complain,it's a suggestion."
2,"Whatsapp was perfectly fine on its own before this idiotic update. Its just turning into telegram and kind of instagram atp and i hate it. Iod mind yall having updates and all but is the channels update really neccessary??? And its not like anyone will use it cause like i said it has twitter, insta and telegram for thatüòíüôÑ"
4,WhatsApp is very useful for everyone.but now a days mostly giving updates..one thing you are not absorving? In the WhatsApp status filters not working...I m absorving since 3 months.. please update that ?? While I m posting the status I m getting irritating to see the filters not working üò°üò°
1,"I have been unable to get access to my whatsapp account for 3days now,its so annoying. Help me out please, am missing a lot of things. Please kindly help restore my whatsapp account for me to enable me fix my work. Thanks I Need Help Please, Kindly Restored my Whatsapp account. Thank You"
4,It nice experience to chat with friend Place add web scanner to add more accounts like instagram and fb.to avoid downloading other what's app...add the feature ore Truecaller to whatapp that the other one is on call or not .it helps to avoide unnecessary call while on our fev call.....
1,"Terrible new update that was SO not necessary. It's too crowded, and hectic just to look at muted statuses and even deleting multiple statuses at once. WORST UPDATE EVER."
1,Latest update with channel with updates catagory is very worst update in WhatsApp. Whatsapp history uniqueness of whatsapp is status in vertical order. This is the feature which differs and likes from Facebook and Instagram. I feel like why I need to use WhatsApp if all the apps from meta is like same then what is the purpose of single whatsapp app.
1,"What's app is showing me different pattern of what app, not at all like others, can't upload a screen short to show what a huge difference is. 3-4 uninstalled n deleted account n relogined and reinstalled. But still the same problem .... Please slove the problem"
5,I don't have word for this app it's amazing and now what's app has double tap feature and also it has status voice recorder it's amazing love it Thank u for double tap feature ........
2,"Once updated, the button for muted status whatsapp is gone. I want to unmute other person status whatsapp but cannot. The stupid channel or whatever is annoying and unnecessary there üò°üò°üò° please restore the muted status whatsapp !!!!!!!!"
1,"Status tab is replaced with Updates. Not a good one even friends uploaded status time shows wrong or yesterday, it's not showing specific time. Please rollback"
4,"It is really easy to text my friends and family it is realy amazing but i give a for beacause i herad they hack people so that is why i give a four if you agree then put four or five or if you digree put three,two,one if it is really really bad for you then untnitall under 9."
4,Love WhatsApp but I HATE the latest update. The emoji section is awful and clunky. Please change it back to the way it was before. Haven't seen the other features but I hope they're not as bad.
4,"Overall, I very love this application l. But now a days, WhatsApp showing (Poor network during the voice calls), even I have a full speedy Wifi connection. Dear Meta, please take a look into this issue."
1,My whatsapp account is getting hacked again and again from Sep3rd. I have been sending mail to contact support and there is no final resolution. Pls help in getting final soln. I am afraid it is going to be misused
1,"While downloading videos, it has been displayed that the downloading was unable to complete. Pl. try again. I request what have to do to download the videos without interruption."
1,"Unable to login to WhatsApp due to verification error, my WhatsApp account has been stolen without my consent,I have multiple times tried connecting with WhatsApp but of no use. I request you guys to help me out with this at the earliest"
1,"When we send our uploaded status to someone, it appears that the status has been sent but it shows that this video is not available in your internal memory.please solve this problem as soon."
2,New channel feature is waste ... Did not like it at all Please remove this feature or else give us option whether to keep it not so according those u need can keep and those who don't wanna keep can delete it ..... please do the needful..... thank you ....
3,"Dude, it's so irritating after I updated it today. 15th sept. 2023... Some sussy channels are popping up out of no where.. I can't handle this, it's giving me anxiety.... Ahhhhhhhh I hate this feature... Please remove it üôèüôèüôèüôè"
1,Issue with voice call and video call. The other person is not about to hear me properly. It's always an issue. There is a big that needs to be fixed.
1,"Waste update. Add features should be in our control but.. unnecessarily few channels are asking to follow,, that too unknown members.. not even avoid option... am not satisfied... Old one is best..and this update is looking like unsafe"
3,"Overall app is good, few new features added. However, it's high time scheduling messages should be introduced."
5,"alot of people use WhatsApp for work and personal, i think it would be a great idea to add categories for contacts and groups, and to be able to name the categories ourselves, similar to how Blackberry Messenger used to have"
2,Now these days the status quality level compressed to the low level ü´†i hate that..... I think many of the don't like this kind of updation changes .. developer's need to develop this issue as soon as you can possible üòê
1,"Status become Updates, no problem, BUT I can't search updates now... would like to have that search again in updates, because i liked to view updates on my family, without scrolling to much And why do we need two camera button in updates :'( Please fix it sooooonnnn"
1,The new updates are terrible at the update section. Too much going on there and looks very messy scrolling sideways rather than vertically. Please make this more friendly asap
3,"In the latest update of WhatsApp, of introducing a new feature of channels in watsapp. I have a Mi A3 mobile . And there is no update for me for regarding this . As I have to make a channel on my watsapp. I'm very disappointed"
5,The only problem i have been facing in the new update is we can only see half of the statuses of our contacts and the remaining aren't loading. Buffering is going on as an endless loop. Pls fix this issue ASAP.
1,Call couldn't connect. Can't place calls. Problem. Can't resolve issue. lines keep breaking up. And reconnected. Rubbish App.
5,"It's just not so hectic life all the other social medias I don't know I have never seen a commercial,, post. I've done texts and also video chat with friends. And family it's nice to get to see my kids family and Friends üòÅ"
3,Yesterday I updated it and now from today I am not getting messages or calls. It was fine till yesterday night now it's not. Tried everything... Reinstalled it... Setting change... Everything but not working
3,"Not bad, but some features are annoying. For example the channels, I wish to hide this feature but I cannot."
1,I'm giving it 1 star because before i upload any status its shows its original quality but now I upload a beautiful quality anime video and after its ulpoaded i see its become very low quality i report it but they didn't fix it. Its about status quality problem i ulpoad video in 1080 pixels quality but after its ulpoaded it becomes 360 pixels this is very bad whatsapp is getting worse.
1,"They should have provide an option whether we can have channels or not... That's not given.. it's not correct.. already those channels were being followed in Twitter, Instagram & Facebook.. then what's the need to include in WhatsApp??"
1,Still am facing My watsapp account is banned. Daily I complain but no result I login watsapp show different different error. It's show account banned than after I complain I login again after that it's show u not using official watsapp than I download official watsapp it's show your account is authorised to register watsapp. I mailed so many time but I can't found any solution it's very bad experience my so long using account is not working all my important data and my work is hanged. Pls solve
2,Apparently there's no search button for the 'updates' tab. This new update wants us to scroll all the way if you want to view a specific contact's status ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4,"RECOMMENDATION I'm loving the experience so far with the app, the video calls have gotten clearer but still need some improvements with the quality. I would also like to suggest the WhatsApp status Polls should be introduced. New review : sep 6 2023 I think WhatsApp should have chat heads. Similar to that on Messenger but better and improved."
2,2 stars because the photo was uploaded in status very bad resolution also in profile photo. That version is better than this one.so please add higher resolution also in status.
1,"I seriously don't like the new features of wtsp adding channels in status section. We already have Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for this, we don't want this in whatsapp.Its awful. We want our ‚Äúbefore channel features "" whatsapp back."
1,"I am unable to use this app because when I try to restore my data it gets back to previous page. Also, my mobile is showing that there is a bug in it, so use it after the bug is get fixed. What should I do?"
3,"Easy to use,when you share pictures there's no problem it can easily send or transfer,this is my experience from WgatsApp even vedeo call its very clear."
1,Overheats phone on calls and will ruin phone battery. Video quality of calls is awful these days and audio. Leaving app for these reasons. No app should destroy phones.
4,This is a good messaging platform. Please the developer should add face unlock to the whatsapp. That will be a nice feature especially to phones that doesn't have fingerprint but has face unlock.
2,"Its a good app however, I am unable to Star mark important messages from the groups and also unable to search a person to send a WhatsApp message.it takes forever to search someone...Any possible solution to this??"
1,Worst app I am using this app before because it was too easy to operate. Now In recent updates they introduced channel so it's tricky to use and also by this now we can't able see our muted status .. so pls fix this up .
3,"You all gave us an update yet you removed a very useful feature. Please, return the ""search"" feature for status. Thank you."
1,"I hated the new update. Can't they leave one app normal. We don't want WhatsApp to behave like Instagram, Twitter, telegram. Just leave it how it was. Please bring the old version back the new one is too problematic."
1,"Meta is tend to make whatsapp also a social media channel now, by adding status and now channel also, it should be simple messaging app, not an another social media app, atleast give a feature to disable or hide these unnecessary updates."
2,One should be able to swap either video or voice calls from computer to phone and vice visa when you want to leave your work station. Kindly review.
1,Channel option is worst option for me üòî It never helpful for me and it's irritating to see on screen on place of status........ I wanna say please remove this feature from our WhatsApp and try to find some useful features
5,"Dear WhatsApp I'm here to give u a small suggestion, I think WhatsApp should have a edit caption option for WhatsApp Status after uploading the status, so that no need of deleting the status if any mistakes in the caption and need a ""Open with"" option like we get in windows to open pdfs links etc.."
4,Please improve screenshare option when video call is running. This is very slow & stuck every time. This is not smoothly running.
1,There must be separate tab for Channel same like community its is getting difficult to view the status with Channel. Either Channel come under the chat option under sperate section same like Archived we can click and check the and the channels.
3,"I like Whatsapp, but I'm disappointed in the newest update, please get rid of the channels!!!!! I don't like using status anymore because of the new update."
2,I hate the channels... the new update is not good and having to put in your phone number to delete it... is to personal.. I don't want to share my phone number with just anyone.
1,"With its recent updates whatsapp is trying to be more addictive, with the introduction of channels and infinite scroll. Please keep it simple we already have apps like instagram to view what we love and kill time."
1,New update of whatsapp is extremely pathetic. I am really disappointed. I wasn't expecting such nonsense update from you. The sticker and emoji icon portion is updated and that is not convenient
2,"NO DIRECT FEEDBACK OPTION PRESENT OTHERWISE GOOD. SHOULD OFFER LEARNING MODULES FOR NEW USERS OR OLD ONES TO GET THEIR HANDS EASY ON SUCH FEATURES. BACKUP IS VERY POOR WHEN DEVICE CHANGES NO PREVIOUS CHATS ARE RECOVERED. MANY PICS AND CHATS ARE LOST DUE TO UNAWARENESS ABOUT BACKUP. WEB VERSION IS SO THIRD CLASS ALSO ONE CANNOT OPERATE MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS ON WEB VERSION, SHOULD ENABLE THIS. DIFFICULT TO SEND MICROSOFT EXCEL AND WORD FILES THEY DONT OPEN."
2,"While adding pics in status the image quality was very poor even though added high quality of pics üòî very very disappointed, kindly fix the issue."
1,"This channel feature is inappropriate for some users who doesn't wants that in their WhatsApp I'd, it's more useful for someone who's creator not everyone is creator tho either give us options to choose to keep it or not otherwise remove the feature it's so useless."
1,Same problem again choosing emoji. The text jumps to the top of the screen. Sometimes it doesn't move but the wallpaper does
1,When WhatsApp prefers security then why are you giving option to show and follow channels. That's rubbish. I am disappointed about this feature which I am not able to remove this.
5,"Hi WhatsApp, I think you should give edit option in chat so that person can modify his words/ sentence or other thing while doing MSG if he type anything worng by mistake.I hope you understand how much necessary this option should be available in your app. People have to delete there whole msg if they type something worng and retype again. Pls it my request bring this option in next update"
1,"after this new update its looking so annoying , please remove the channle follow option from whatsapp everyone is not intrested in these channels . Some want to share imp files of study and notes.And if someone wants to can follow on insta, youtube and many other pplatforms"
5,Experience is so good but I am here to give an advice you should add AI service in WhatsApp that can make more best to you . One more thing we can't send the big size videos like 30 mint please remove it .
1,"Basically whatsapp is good .but they are banning the whatsapp accounts without sending any warnings or alerts messages. It is really a considerable problem. I requested whatsapp company to un ban my whatsapp account, but they didn't do anything."
2,"It would be great if u had added Highlights feature like Instagram , so we could save our memories from status. Hope you'll take my opinion Thanks..."
3,"I keep seeing people talk about this Channels feature, but I haven't got that anywhere on my version. As far as I know, my app is up to date ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3,"I like the app and all but the update about the emoji slot part, it isn't comfortable swiping up to pick an emoji. Pls I would really appreciate it if you could take a look into it."
3,"Version of my WhatsApp application has been changed from last one month. I Have taken help from WhatsApp help but it was not useful. And due to this change, only in my WhatsApp. I AM Concerned about my privacy. Only my WhatsApp has changed like this none of my friends and family is using this version."
2,The latest updates are cool but it's annoying removing the search icon at the status bar. I've noticed i can't search status from my status list. Pls fix this
1,"This new whatsapp update is the worst,I cant even delete many status at a time, I have to view first then delete one by one which is bad,nd pls add a search feature to the status page back I have a lot of status but what if I only want to view one particular one do I have to scroll all the way down its bad pls"
3,"The new update with channels is cool, but the status should have remained in vertical arrangement. Horizontal seems annoying ."
1,new updte sucks. menu in the bottom is very annoying. previous one is better and easy. stickers takes too much time to load.
5,"I just try the whatsapp new feature of group voice chat, but what I will like to suggest is that ""Allow the admin/creator of the voice/video chat in a group to remove anyone during the call likewise enable the admin/creator of the voice/video chat to end the call totally rather than letting each user remove theirself at any time"" SECONDLY also try to let the admin/creator of the voice/video chat to be able to mute and unmute any member of the conversation. Thanks Aileru Mukaram Adeyanju"
5,WA is one of the best and must have App for staying in touch with Loved ones & Friends worldwide..!! WA keeps upgrading itself by adding many useful Features making it even more User-friendly app to use...
3,"The new whatsapp update where the ""channels"" are being included is not showing in some users even after they update the app. Please inquire into this problem as soon as problem."
3,Good app The Latest update is annoying. I've been trying to get my number registered but it's not responding . Keeps telling me couldn't send SMS or call check back in 1hour. I can't even change number
2,"I would like to inform them that I found a bug in the Status section. I deleted my Status 5-6 hours ago, but it is still showing "" Deleting"". Please look into this matter."
1,Should have died a hero...Lived to long to become the villain..from a elegant simple messenger service to a cluttery mini Instagram. I wonder who's idea was it to include channels on WhatsApp. After the new update thinking of switching to telegram.
2,"The new emoji panel is ugly, too big and unnecessary. Just leave it the way it was, with the size the system keyboard."
3,Fair. But this particular channels update is very distracting. I'll suggest you find a way we can hide the channels it's all over my screen.
1,What a nonsense useless feature WhatsApp channel ! Why should I use this nonsense channel feature while i have other apps n TVs to watch news . It's absolutely unnecessary to increase app size by giving such nonsense feature which cannot be turned off by the user .
1,"i have an s8+ samsung phone that is quite old at least 5y old. recently , i installed this latest version of whatsapp and the phone started randomly crashing out of no reasons. especially starting with camera function"
5,I am unable to receive or send post to anyone since I have travelled from Gujarat and some other places. Please look into the matter and re connect and make me feel good with your services... Please reopen my whatsApp as previous.. Thank youüôè
1,Normally I'd save my WhatsApp status but since the new update I'm unable to save my own WhatsApp status.... and I'm turned off by it bcuz I use my status to share daily psychic üîÆ readings üìö but now my service has been terminated due to WhatsApp new update.... now many people won't be able to know what's going on in their lives!! Plz üôè bring back that feature üôè üò´ üò≠ üò©
5,"Easy to send messages, and you can send up to 20 pictures at the same time. Gets updated with new stuff frequently."
1,The new update is very disgusting ah what's that you can't even search for people and watch their status but unnecessary channels in which we can join on telegram and the rest and new see. I am very anry with your new update is really bad
3,Loved using WhatsApp but lately it's turning into another Facebook app. For the love of all great apps please don't ruin WhatsApp with channels and social updates and buttons everywhere. Leave that on Facebook and Instagram and keep it simple.
1,What have you done to the status bar? Please remove the Update bar. There is no need for it. Who wants all those unnecessary channels. This is not YouTube.
1,"I didn't like the new channel feature, please remove it , I want it private , I'm not using it though but still , you guys forcefully updated it I don't want those channels option, stop it now ."
2,"WhatsApp as a whole is fine but the newest update as of 16/09/2023 is so glitchy that it's become really frustrating to use (hence my 2 star rating). If not for that, then it would get 5 stars"
3,"This aap is good but one glitch i am facing is that, whenever i click photos using the flash light that time the image gets totally white and is not of use, so plz resolve this issue."
3,Whatsapp is good but day by day the whatsapp increase there feature after update i personally don't like it. because WhatsApp is the only app which used to keep our security but looking at its features it seems that now it too will not keep our privacy.
2,It is good app until the watsapp channel update launched... worst update ever..i am requesting u please remove that update from watsapp its useless feature.watsapp is best for chatting only not for these useless things..if its not possible for everyone please tell me how i remove it
1,"I like it so so much it's a good app which is very easy to share videos, music, images, massage's, voice call and video call without having any issues. I love it"
5,The app is amazing. Visually impaired people have full access to it with all screen readers. Thanks to Meta company.
3,"Hi, i just saw the new updates feature i really like if but can you make an option so i can turn it off or choose not to have the ""updates"" and just regular status pls ;) prob because its just kinda annoying to look at or i jUsT WAnt tHE ReGUlaR sTAtuS bACKüò≠"
1,"This new update doesn't allow one to search people's status update, it makes it more tedious now. You have to scroll and look for the person's status before you can view this. Please this needs to be rectified. Allow users to search for updates they want to view."
1,"Disappointed after the recent update of 'Channels', WhatsApp feels like it has no privacy, the privacy has now gone and it's super boring. We actually want a Normal messaging app. I HATE IT. Bring back the old WhatsApp. üëé"
1,"I have used my number for many years. So I have telegram channels, Facebook and etc with the same number. So I decided to move my business to WhatsApp from telegram. Adding my clients. You decide to block my number. I never added people before as if I valuated your rules before. WhatsApp sucks. I'll remember keep my telegram."
2,Please add a status update option in which we can update our status and if. There is we make any type of mistake in photo status we can reupdate that in written statement in case if we make a status we can not update that status After this I m disappointed to see it so please make sure that we can reupdate the status and the major point of that is we can't share alarge quality size file that's why I request you to please settle these issue
2,The status and images are not getting loaded fastly. But the other features are awesome.
4,"When i want to reply someone's status, my phone is being laggy when i add emotions by touching emo icons in chat bar. I dont know Is it actually the error of my phone or the app."
1,Very bad experience while using video calls. All the time it's showing blurry images.
2,Was a nice app but they ruined it. It's so laggy and they changed the sticker and emoji options. Ugh. It's not very user friendly
5,Nice app we can contact to people who are anywhere in the world. We can connect to our friends and relatives and its video calling is good. Nice app.
5,"Hi, Sorry to say that system generated messages from WhatsApp support is not helpful in resolving the issues I have been facing for the past few months. I humble request is that someone in Whats App support may kindly look into my issues and resolve the problems permanently without further delay. Regards Vijayakumar C"
5,"Overall the performance of app has been improved alot but from few days i have been facing an issue that i can not watch my video clip that i upload on whatsapp status, it just somehow stops playing after few seconds."
1,Remove those channels options. These are very irritating and mood spoiler things. Getback old muted status feature and remove channels option .
5,This is an app which actually connects when phone call is not available. You will not believe we get call on whats app when no other means was available. Thanks whatsapp Keep rocking and updating new features
1,"There may be a function for channels for some people but for those who it doesn't, it ruins the experience on WhatsApp. Please make it possible to turn them off."
1,Earlier WhatsApp was the best app.....a simple application which connected people.....but now with the latest update I would say its a copied mini version of Instagram..... WhatsApp was easier to use for every age group but now it is not. Shame on! You all just want money... shame on you all
4,Improvement is definitely getting alot now and a few updates now. I would love to see a lock for important messages to keep on WhatsApp if that's at all possible. 4 stars
1,New Update tab instead of status is very annoying and not user friendly. WhatsApp prime aim is to message and chat. The unnecessary features can lower the no. of users.
4,Best chatting app ever. Please whatsapp should separate contacts chats from group chats (they should be put on different tabs) so as to reduce flooding of chats and notifications in the chats row. Saves you alot of time navigating through. Thank you.
1,Keep WhatsApp as massaging app no need to change it into Instagram or Facebook. We have both apps already installed. For God sake change or remove updates option and set back to status as before. No one asked for channels in WhatsApp
5,"Hey, could you please add a feature where we can share music or audio files through status? Anyways, I really love your app, thanks."
1,"The latest update is full of nonsense, like if I wanted to follow pages I'd go on Instagram, I been using whatsapp coz it's relaxed without too much distraction and why are the muted statuses now 4 buttons away... honestly that's too much work"
5,"It's a very good apk, I have a suggestion for you and would be happy if you could add it, Add music option in what's app status like in Instagram, I'll be very thankful to you if you do the same + add music to photo while sending"
1,Horrible experience with the new channels thing. It looks horrendous. It should be an option to hide that thing.
1,Very worst app.. I ever seen. my number was banned from whatsapp team when I regeater to what's app it's shows that you need the officila whatsapp to use this account error was showing .i am facing this problem since 3months please solve this issue
1,WhatsApp just suck big time. With the new updates they have added more ways to collect data and shove ads. With channels on update status tab it looks so horrible. What a waste app.
5,This provides a great system of communication both audio and visual. Makes communications real both in the U.K. and for international calls; brilliant!
1,I have to update so many times and it does not support most of the status videos. Another problem is I can't download documents what i had to download like this.
1,These channels stuff is the worst thing ever. I just wanna talk to my friends and see updates from them. We don't need channels on WhatsApp. It's so annoying
1,"Hei WhatsApp, we already have Facebook and an Instagram and then a thread..why trying to make WhatsApp somewhat similar to those apps? The new update on status really disappointed me. I use WhatsApp to chat with my personal contacts and to see their status updates. For updates from celebrities , I can use Instagram or Facebook. Here you are trying to hide the status updates of layman and projecting the channels of celebrities.. total disappointment.."
5,Kindly Add one more feature that is Auto Crop the pic ore Documents (Crop option Already Available but Auto Crop is not kindly add or Update the Crop option).Hopefully team review my Comment and oblige us. Thank you Also wait for positive Response
4,"When uploading a video that's longer than 30seconds, the audio doesn't go along with what the video is saying and it's annoying"
1,Most worst experience after the update like what'sApp was so easy and simple before.Why to add updates instead of status and channel or give us the access to use both willingly .We don't want new updates and new or whatever we already have alot of options.Whatsapp was simple we could text our friends and family watch their updates but now we have to do more effort .I don't know whether you'll make the update more usable but now I'm downgrading WhatsApp due you guys
1,Why do we now have to go far and beyond to see the muted status'es? Status'es have been muted for a reason. The new channels feature is literally taking up so much space
1,"this new WhatsApp update is so not it, I'm just trying to interact with friends and family,i do not want to be involved with different channels, that can stay on Facebook please! !"
1,"Brands are spamming my inbox, WhatsApp used to be a private messaging app, now it's just another Facebook where brands can get hold of your mobile number and spam you with offers and ads, I've blocked multiple numbers of single brand, now I've given up."
5,Wonderful instant messaging app. The features are amazing and there's customized notification for each contact.
4,"Dear sir,  Unknowingly I thought that yoma WhatsApp app was from WhatsApp Messenger app. That's why I downloaded it and entered my mobile number. Immediately I deleted that app too. But after that my WhatsApp number is not received any new messages and all even after updating WhatsApp app and rebooting my redmi 7mobile .  Seriously I thought it was from real WhatsApp. As am a social worker, The WhatsApp is very very important to me. So Please I humbly  request you to rectify the problem/"
4,I m giving it 4 star becoz all the features are best in WhatsApp its been my favourite app bt there should the unsend option instead of delete for everyone... Nd the new feature of switching account in WhatsApp should be removed nd there should not be allowed to login to what's app in not more than 1 device. By giving the feature of switching account nd allowing to login in more than 1 device its being risky nd its being harming the privacy. So pls try to fix this for keeping our privacy safe.
4,"So far it's a great app , but it would be 5 star if you updated the app to be able to send up to hour long videos it can only send short videos"
5,I love this app it enables connect with my family and friends in distant areas i prefer using it than other social media platforms. Keep up the good job META..
1,"WhatsApp channels from latest updates really need to be removed from the app. Don't change the WhatsApp slogan ""simple messaging and calling app"" To ""useless one way broadcasting app""."
1,Iam facing a technical issue it's coming out of the app every time.. I just sent my feedback I re intalled it and I updated it but still I can't able to see the results
1,"Please remove channels. I use this app to talk to friends and family, not to see stuff posted by newspapers, celebrities and football clubs. We have Facebook for that. And I can't even find important channels, such as that of the Dutch government and the Dutch ministry of defence."
5,"I just love the app, using it since 2013.. I suggest that don't ruin the messenger WhatsApp by adding so many functions in it like market nd channels.. let it be a simultaneous messenger only"
1,"I hate the latest update of adding channels on your status page. Why bother maintaining different apps, just shut Facebook, Instagram and just add all the features to whatsApp... Just to understand nobody's liking this khichdi..."
1,It use to be very good app. Till the latest update and it keep saying... This account isnt allow to use whatsapp. Pls try to correct every error on this app.... Because it annoying.
4,This is so on reliable platform I have been founding is heard to access my WhatsApp account it's not going through soon you have the registared number why not send a verification code so I can make use of it back. Thanks for your understanding
3,Kindly extend the HD photos to the status function as well. The downgrade in quality of photos when uploaded as a status is shocking.
2,I mean what is the point to differentiate between what's app and Instagram? Please don't make it similar by adding some channel feature. Keep it as whatsapp don't try it to be another Instagram.
1,"WhatsApp used to be simple and easy, but the recent update added a bunch of useless stuff that's really irritating. I know a lot of people feel the same way. Hopefully, they'll listen to the feedback and make some changes soon!"
2,"Disappearing message is annoying!!! This function should be limited to the individual's phone/account only. In groups, only admin should have this function."
1,New update is irritating...the channel switching update is really unwanted.The muted status switch is confusing at all. Mend this for keeping Whatsapp popular as it was.
3,"Beware of scammers who try to threaten/scare you with false information (do not ever tap/click any URL link or button from them), Whatsapp is not a really secure platform in that regard as anyone with unknown number can reach you."
1,The one star is for the latest update. I do NOT want any trashy channels an accidental click away. Do channels like telegram or not at all.
1,I have been experiencing buffering while viewing stories and sending messages for quite some time. Please fix this quickly.
1,"HEY DEAR WHATSAPP COMMUNITIES TEAM. HELP. I AM NOT ABLE TO LOGIN WHATSAPP ACCOUNT WITH MY NUMBER BECAUSE WHATSAPP OTP VERIFICATION CODE IS NOT COMING ON MY NUMBER. I WAITED A LOT, THE FEET ARE NOT COMING.SO PLEASE HELP SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANKU Otherwise people leave your app because you don't have any customer service üòû"
1,So why is my numbers not able to work . It says that they made a review on my account and now im unable to use whatsapp this app is stupud . All my contacts . School groups . Documents and my chats are still on my numbers yet i cant access my whatsapp
1,Channels sucks completely...don't need this hidden commercials. And now u put it to my status page. This app turns into a commercial app and it suchst!!
1,"WhatsApp plz provide an option to hide channel's list from below the status, all people do not want to see it in WhatsApp, they have other option to see it. some are using simple and privately, that's it"
1,"I hate the new update. Throws me off everytime i open the app smh.. the structure is ridiculous status,updates whatever is now called ,stickers,etc please fix.. all my things are all over the place."
2,"I don't know for real what's wrong I was always using this app and lately I just bought a new sim card with a new number, and after adding it and working with it for 2 days it banned me from nothing and it was telling me I did something which is not making me following the terms while I didn't do anything at all on my phone."
2,"For a while ago I updated my WhatsApp and I found a section of Updates instead of Status.I really don't like it at all I think WhatsApp should not make it social ,we were happy with the old version.If you are updating it in regards to security, privacy and other features that will be good but this making it as social platform should not be acceptable.Please change the update section to status section again."
1,"I'm using WhatsApp since 7+ years what's I'm hateing the most is newly update channel features. I just don't want to have this feature or atleast I want to hide this . Rest i have no concerns with WhatsApp Messenger, other than that everything is great."
1,Whenever i put my phone on airoplane mode and after removing airoplane mode...... my contacts whatsapp status also removed and not show to me that status again .....fix this problem.
1,"Changing phone and transferring data to it is risky New update of channels is of no importance, channels should be removed. Whatsaapp is gonna small place with alot unnecessary stuff."
5,Thank You For adding Status reactions... As I posted this comment a year earlier..And now I need an update.when we send a Image it should show to the other user as loading Image or something like typing recording audio like that ‚ú®
3,"my account was hacked, so I have been advised to delete and reinstall my same account on the same system (Samsung Android phone)‚Ä¶ fair enough to find out that I lost all over 2000 pictures beside the chats and most of my friends address. how to retrieve unbacked up items, specially pictures on"
5,I just want to say but I was wondering why don't take it to the next level because most of the WhatsApp users some of them use it a lot for the business and work so why don't you create like an option to create working chats where you can enable like the features like clock-in clock-out location where in real time and water marks pictures and a schedule log for the workers and features like a hour log for the pay rate of the employees WhatsApp has almost everything they just got to create that
1,The app keeps adding a message to use official whatsapp yet its the same playstore app.I have tried with another it will accept after one week of use it will still show the same message..I have contacted the customer care but no help ..
5,Great so far. I am an aged person. Can you do automatic updating of the Android automatically whenever new versions are available. Thank you.
5,"Very good functioning of the app . But the images quality is poor so, WhatsApp should improve this ... Afterall all the functioning of the app is great . Keep it up the good work‚úåÔ∏èüíê"
5,"Hi, Verifying your phone number with a registration code is the only way you can activate your account. To complete the registration process and activate your account, your device must: * Have an active SIM card for the number you‚Äôre activating. Unsupported phone numbers, such as VoIP, landlines, toll-free, paid premium numbers, universal access numbers (UAN), shared cost, and personal numbers can‚Äôt be registered on WhatsApp. Make sure you enter your phone number in full international format."
1,"Horrible sticker interface, keeps jumping to irrelevant stickers, keyboard keeps hanging somewhere on the screen. Maybe test your updates before releasing"
1,"I am very unhappy with this new version of whatsapp. Those channels that you tried to introduce to us are making my whatsapp so messy and I don't like it. Remove the channels and let me communicate with the people I know, I will follow famous people and pages on Facebook. I'm so unhappy"
3,Whats App good but you need to improve some things like ..we would like one option like without net we want to make a call from whats App .will it be available ? One more things like using whats App can do you have search engine like google ...like we can search anything and paste it to any person direct from whats App dont go to google .
1,"The new update changed the interface and is annoying...if I'd want to add a sticker from my favourites, it scrolls completely up from the other tab and comes to the top"
3,Whatsapp Messenger is awesome. No issues with Messenger; however I just upgraded to Whatsapp Business. No issues with Business on my Samsung S22 Ultra. My major problem is that I can't get Whatsapp Business on my Galaxy Watch5 Pro.
2,It was good but not anymore because of its channel feature....plz WhatsApp do it optional....and also if any contact is locked than still people can open it by using lockscreen password....
1,"I can't seem to use it in my phone, it's telling to use an official WhatsApp messenger app, I've uninstalled WhatsApp multiple times and installed it again from play store, but it's still the same problem,...... Please fix this asap."
3,Some scamsters calls both voice and video. There is no feature to restrict such calls which not in our contact list. These calls are increasing daily.
1,The moment I start my watsapp its always shows initialising and often it shwon runtime exception and suddenly closes the application...it creates huge issue for me to simply open the software or write the message
1,"What's App is a very good messaging app, but the quality of photos and videos decreases by putting status in it, so fix it first."
1,"THE UPDATE IS GONNA BE THE DEATH OF ME. Everytime I open up my emojis or gifs, I DON'T KNOW WHERE ANYTHING IS. Just get it back to normal, it's so annoying and I don't think I'll ever get used to it."
2,I am m changing my opinion for WhatsApp due to its worst experience..... I am fed up due to quality issues of uploaded status photos and videos....So so so poor it becomes after upload even if it is taken from DSLR or anything else.....whatsapp must take proper action in this matter....
2,"The new update is terrible, you can't even search a contacts status. also all those included things like Channels News followers and what not are not needed for a private App as this - we already have FB and Thread for such"
3,Everything good.But whenever I upload status on high quality. the pixel are down.The status and pictures blur and the smoothness is gOne and the high quality come to very low quality fix it please üëç
1,"the recent update of hiding whatsapp media from the phone's gallery is the most irritating ,as it makes.it soo difficult to find images that i want to share or see."
1,Worst experience of using this app as it does not have proper system in place while banning accounts. It just bans account without checking the genuineness. So if your foe/s or unknown persons reports or raise complaint against your account for no reason you have to send multiple emails to WhatsApp Support which is of no use at the end of the day. It will be of help if this issue is taken care by the development team for checking the genuineness of the complaint/s raised. Hope they read it.
1,"This is tooo much by WhatsApp i was the loyal user of it still they are choosing to ignore the users, not expected from meta i m Uninstalling now all the things if they are not going to fix this issue in 2hr then what kind of network do they have, i m really disappointed"
4,Last update just terrible..yall keep messing up the app...Why can we no longer delete more than one statuses at a time...update wasnt necessary...and if you wanna rewatch a certain status you gotta go thru alll of them again

2,"Since recent updates, the sensitivity is low for stickers and they keep moving once you press them. Also writing seems wonky"

1,I was banned for no reason and then they unbaned me after 12-15 hours But then also I am unable to login my watsapp account it is showing that use office watsapp but already I am using official WhatsApp and even after 4 days of continuous mail they are not fixing it they are reply the same message to me again and again please fix this issue watsapp please fix my issue
1,"WhatsApp has become very poor. Poor signal, can't hear my caller clear, vs caller can't hear me , poor graphics. I so disappointed!!!! I'm going to use a different calling app and leave WhatsApp !!"
1,"Worst Update I have ever seen, what you guys are doing, don't create hazards in a simple app, don't follow telegram or line , something looks good when they are simple, bogus update"
3,"Please make it more user friendly. I want to tag everyone at the same time, but whatsapp support it, I have to everyone, one by one, this is wasting a lot of time."
1,Login Errors No Verification code is receive yet.......I'm trying again and again to login my whatsapp number But there is some problem with my Whatsapp Login and Can't receive the code for further process... Kindly recover my whatsapp ASAP. Thank you

3,Is anyone else experiencing the problem where your whatsapp calls are not showing up on your screen since the latest Samsung update üôÑ and you have to physically open the app to see who's calling or use the pull down tab
5,"Hi bug alert In the whatsapp status / story.. the time shown is incorrect.. it should so 5 mins left or 1 day ago.. but currently for a status i uplaoded yesterday at 13:59 its showing 15 mins ago on the status page at 13:44 today, it should rather show 15 mins left.. when i select my status that time it is showing the correct time it was uploaded.. keep the feature as how much time remaining for the last status to be deleted.. instead of ""ago"" make changes in the code to make it ""left"""

3,Not possible to use dual application in dual sim phones except going in to guest mode which is cumbersome in my case. Disappearance of message - Is it possible to put only for specific name or group?
4,"Good app so far but consider the following. Can you please dedicate a separate window for Groups so we can easily search for Groups. Please, restore the count of WhatsApp contacts. We need to know how many contacts we have on WhatsApp as it used to be. Latest updates don't have it again."
1,"Requires do not disturb permissions on Android 12, without that which you have not included the calls will not make any sound. An auto answer to speaker whitelist would be nice."
2,Please fix your bug. It's saying I'm unable to send audios when it's in mp3 format and I allowed microphone and storage access
1,Which is a channel feature in which people's personal channels are coming. Don't like that feature at all This should be done in such a way that the people of their choice can remove it.

3,"Can u guys look in to stickers section , previous was too good , that new one is confusing , n didn't show all stickers in the row , we have to find through scrolling , just look in to this issue pls its actually disturbing ü§åü§å"
5,This app is the best app to text and call on ad recently they added screen sharing while you video call and I love it so much!! Keep up with the good work whatsapp!
1,The new channel update is useless and annoying.Meta is trying to turn whatsapp into Instagram cause many people are sick of Instagram as it's basically formulated version of tiktok now they deliberately trying to shove insta on WhatsApp and turning into dating app won't be surprised if they start comment section in WhatsApp channels too.
1,"Bring back the search button for status in the new ""updates"" page. Don't fancy the new looks for the emoji and stickers setup."
1,"There must be an option to delete media from channel, because a channel took more and more space from media. Please make option to delete media oterwise Whatsapp storage space will run out."

1,"The new whatsapp channel is adding annoying distraction to the status tab. Either you remove it completely, or just do it like telegram app, make a new tab for it!"
3,The problem is that WhatsApp doesn't let you make a new chat after you've created a new contact and contact is who I want to add. I would of gave it 5/5 if it wasn't for this. Please sort it out
4,"This thing of channel's is a little bit boring,can't we please have an option not to have them cause going to view status takes up some time now due to channels appearing,or make them have their slide aswell"

1,"The app is very helpful and the support and customer care is even better. My account is blocked, I emailed, now it's going to be 24 hours. not unblocked yet"
1,1. Please add the feature of being able to be logged in on multiple devices 2. make the recommended channels list hideable 3. Add the option to turn on disappearing messages for only archived chats.
2,"My account was hacked and it seems like it's going to be hard get it back from the hacker! Absolutely no help from customer service, you are alone!"

1,Too Much of unwanted features. Making the app look way too complex and difficult. Just keep it simple you MOROONS.
5,it's very very good at it as non-intrusive what does not continually and she was same questions every 10 minutes it lets you enjoy the page enjoy the people you talk with and post pictures chat with them and leave messages or receive ..
3,1 problem. Why am I not getting the channels to subscribe to nor is it saying update it still says status but on my wife's phone it gives her the option to subscribe to channels and viewed status pops up in circles?
2,"Reduced to 2 stars from 5 because what is this unnecessary new update with the ""channels""? I used to like whatsapp, because it seemed more personal. I don't want to be following any ""channels"" i.e. public figures."
1,I don't understand this new version of a thing üò° I can't view videos on my status ad I can't post videos also üò° since Three days now üò© you people should look for a solution because it is tiring ü§¶üèΩ I can't use my money to buy data update d to your so called new version ad still be giving me problem smh üò°

1,"Been experiencing problems lately. Everytime i update this app, it gives me problems. I havent been able to access it for about a week now"
1,Your app is just soo useless... It was bestest app in past but your improvements are making it worst app ever! Just like Instagram your WhatsApp also sucks ... It is not showing others my activity statust until I go to settings just to check up ... Meta apps are getting worst nowadays üóø sorry to say but your advance features are useless!!
3,Overall it's a really good app but I think we need filters in whatsapp more than channels while sending video message or doing video calls.
4,"I have put my status of 15 seconds and I can see only 7 seconds of my own status but other can full status ,why is it ? , please fix this problem. This problem has started from last week ."
1,"After i change fon, and want to register new number to old fon, its say it not supported.. It because my whatsapp version is old version.. But when sent email to supporter team they ask me to download new version but it still same.. Worse !"

1,"I landed the UK last week and bought a new UK Vodafone sim card and registered it to use whatspp. I think I only used for a few messages so far but my account was banned by whatsapp. Definitely sure I.didnt violate any terms, please follow.up my case as I just tied the number with many things and it would be so trouble to get another number."
5,My opinion is that this WhatsApp is the best ever... Simple to customize settings but I suggest that you should at least add a feature which will allow us to save status like any other WhatsApp ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
4,"Bug in privacy settings: When selecting ""Who can see my last seen""-> ""Contacts"" AND ""Who can see when I'm online""-> ""Same as last seen"", Contacts can't see when you are online."
1,"As soon as an HD video is uploaded to WhatsApp, it gets uploaded in bad quality. I am very upset because of this and all the people too please solve this problem Thank you üôè"
3,This app is becoming more and more like Instagram. Please hide the new channel tab. I don't want to have to see it all the time. It should be optional. Thanks
2,"The quality of videos and photos are decreasing in status.Even if the photo or video is in high quality,after we put status quality automatically decrease."
3,"Can anyone tell me how can I activate the video note, I do have the latest version and still when I press on the voice recording icon, it does not change to the video icon"
2,"This update is worst to use. It doesn't have search option in status updates. In status bar, whatsApp give unwanted channels"

1,"I had a very bad experience, using this application cause I was trying to share my location to my friends but it was sharing my location completely wrong."

5,"It's a good app to text with friends\family, all tho I can't really make a avatar, when I try to make a avatar its all ways glitches. But on the other hand its a good app."
2,The new update tab with channels has become more frustrating then helpful. It should get its own space or be removed.
1,Why channels are added to WhatsApp which has no use for us. If it is added we should have an option not to see it. It's simply a unwanted thing we are forced to see.
1,Why can't we post videos and photos in HD Quality on WhatsApp by now. Please there should be an upgrade regarding the quality of post on status. This goes for all other apps related to META as well
5,One of the best messaging app you will find on play store. Just exceptionally excellent üëç. The META team just need to curb out all them fake WhatsApp out there.
1,Please remove the new update on status. It is ridiculous. You have hidden my friends status and are advertising unnecessary channels. Please stop it.
1,"Why your development team hasn't worked on improving the Status upload quality, it's pathetic and it's better we stop uploading any sort of status when the app can't afford the resolution quality. Very poor work team WhatsApp"

Already there's so many distraction in the others apps..So, it would be better for everyone if there's no any further updates regarding to make another version of shorts & reels application..:("
1,New update is something i really don't like. The channels and updates of public figure and groups should be limited to Instagram. Please don't invade my personal space zucc!
4,"All about this app is ok, but one thing we have a biomatric whatsapp feature but also have a another options to unlock WhatsApp like password together,some times fingure print sensor doesn't work properly then wait for timeing to get another chance thats why plz add also password option üòÉ"
4,"It's a really wonderful app for communication and it has become a part of everyones daily life.More than calls everyone uses WhatsApp.But you still need a lot os improvements like shre messages more than 5 chats at a same time, pin more than 3 chats and so more.But still love you so much WhatsApp."
1,"I have a request. Please let me delete really old messages or edit old messages. When I regret saying something and I want to delete it, it says ""Delete for me"" but I want it to ""Delete for everybody"". I can't delete it so I try editing it, I cant edit nor delete old messages. With deleting old messages, I would've given 5 stars. Please change it so I can delete old messages.

2,"When i changed my phone, i logged my whatsapp account to my new phone, but every message is randomly recieved beetwen the old and new phone. So i need to constantly check both phones."
1,"Channels update sucks, getting unwanted things. This makes Whatsapp horrible and not to use it. Soon I will stop using whatsapp and uninstall it. Developers think they can impose anything on users and as it is free we will okay in using it."
3,The new update is too annoying. I don't wanna see unnecessary channels pictures or anything. Please update to remove that whoever want to remove!
1,"I hv two contact numbers, with a number i m using watspp from many years but, from last week I m facing issues to log in , in fact I hv entered my both numbers but still can't be able to log in. Kindly solve dis issue."

2,"What's the use of the new ""channels section just below the status if someone can open it to check after subscribing??? "" No need adding the new feature if it won't function properly."
1,"my whatsapp keeps disturbing. I'm asked to restore my chat history then I eventually loss some chats. worst of all, today I can't even restore my chats, it's keep saying something went wrong with your whatsapp."

1,I don't want channels. I prefer simplicity of app. Please give option to opt out of channels completely.
1,"Please remove Updates option from Whatsapp and bring back the Status option. It is a personal messaging app and not meant for some social media platform. We dont like the option, please remove it"

1,"New update sucks, please remove the channels feature. I get that fb bought WhatsApp and everything is under meta but we already have these things on Instagram and Facebook, we don't need them on WhatsApp! WhatsApp was originally a messaging app, leave it as such!!"
1,"Why the hell is picture quality do worst while uploading it to the status ? Th picture will be so good and when it's uploaded on to the status it's so bad and poor in clarity and blurred , what nonsense is that the picture loses its full quality while it is updated to the status"
2,The recent update that you Have replaced status with updates and channel is not at all good... not at all appreciatable.sorry but please make it optional.
5,PLEASE UNDO THE RECENT UPDATE ! We don't need the bubble type status feature. We were accustomed to the columns of statuses... Please undo the update.
1,"What pure s#!T‚Ç¨ is this ""channel"" feature. How do i turn that off?? I want my whatsapp to be clean and devoid of those time consuming updates. If i want that i have insta, fb and X. What problem do you have in providing us a clean non addictive experience?"
1,"Seriously do better with the new updates. I hate the channels and how WhatsApp status is. However, kudos to your HD photos and videos option"
3,"When you are still busy typing chat messages, it sometimes just switches off deleting the message. Thus, you have to restart typing afresh again. So annoying"
1,Update is worst...as I'm not able to add group members in my group...if I do so... my account is not allowed to use what's app...it's a forth time..I'm facing such issue...
5,i like this app very much i like its features like new emoji and sticker .The editing option is the best i can edit every mistake in my text .amazing i would like to give it 5 stars
4,From last update i am facing an issue Chats notification are not popping up on screen or in status bar and i have to open WhatsApp to check that either i got a message from someone or not? Kindly fix this issue
2,"Used whatsapp for yrs now but this update feature called ""updates,"" is simply not the move. It so inconvenient to swipe for statuses just like insta. I don't like it"
3,This past years and months i really thankful on this apps because i can easily communicate my friends and familys.but this past weeks and day why if i open my whatsapp is close and it says my account is in review.so i use another number again to use whatsapp its really hard because it waste money to buy new phone number or simpack..so please can you assist me why my whatsapp account is loce or in revies
3,"hey Meta, I hate that update on channels, like you could place it under communities or something, it really crumps up space especially considering I really won't be joining any, that could really improve the most recent update üò≠ but I regret updating nonetheless so please."
2,"Channel feature needs improvement. Mostly they share links to promote their monitory accounts like Instagram, YouTube. Prohibit to share the link, only permit the original content otherwise this feature will wii be spam."
4,Very good and useful for personal and business communications but if we have a chat lock for contacts or any lock for archived chats for more security would be appreciated.
1,15/sep/2023 I updated WhatsApp and I got updates instead of status ....and there are channels in updates which is much much irritating at all .please remove updates and give us status back you may give a perticular section for channels and all but make simple stausy .. truly irritating update ..
5,It's a little bit bad but it is very good. I have been having this from a long time and it was very nice. The reason for my bad saying is that when I try to call someone it ask daily how is the call . So I hope it will be better soon. üôÇüôÇ
1,Update feature is not good and irritated.. Channel is not good features. Please roll back new version.
2,Image quality: the images are getting trimmed and quality sucks. We take best pictures and the trimming ruines our pics. Work in this and allow us to update best quality pics.
1,Takes alot of space that you can't install other app and updates are always available and if you don't update you can't even use further irritating and my backup data I can't get after reinstalling app
1,"Chat lock feature is useless , all images of locked chat is shown in gallery. And also video call quality is looks like below 144 pixel."
1,"after updating to the newest version, the search feature in the chat didn't work at all. i've tried re-installing the app, but it's still the same. please fix this."
4,"Although i chose upload my video as media status in high quality, it won't be clear. Video got broken and uploading in poor quality, Rectify this issue ASAP"

2,Very disappointing I'm unable to upload a video which i have caught by my own on whatsapp status i thought it was a glitch somehow but it's not happened one or two days i have been facing it for 3 months on word please fix the glitch soon
1,Since wen WhatsApp started insulting other technologies? Roaming exists long time ago when no one could even think about WhatsApp and it's still working fine. But how come it's stopped working with WhatsApp. Your logic or algorithm stopped working with roaming. Do u discourage tourist to use WhatsApp like if u logged out of WhatsApp u can't get SMS or call while roaming? Ur management n development team terrible. I have never seen that much bad reviews in short period of time. Get good team.
5,Whatsapp is getting better! I love the fact that you guys listen to your user feedback and make adjustments where needed. That's a great one. Keep it up ü§©ü§©
2,Hey whatsapp how are you.....i have a problem with whatsapp my voice messages option can't record my voice.....i don't know what is reason of this error please fix it.....As soon as possible.....
1,"Downloaded it, send my friend two messages. Next day my account was banned for no reason. Requested a review and was told I had violated their terms of service. The alleged violation was never explained. Obviously a mistake that they have refused to fix."
1,"Since the new update has come, it is becoming difficult to use WhatsApp, the status is not showing properly and I am not liking the channel feature at all."
5,WhatsApp a great messenger app I actually love it and I'm very happy to use this app and my cousins call me and they also saw face to face my bhabhi also have a kid I love her but I didn't meet her till 2016 but this app is great daily call her and talk with her thank you so much WhatsApp messages And I also I want to tell one thing like some calls this app hang and does not work properly at important Times but I can manage this but I specially thank you that people who made this app thankyou
1,"They app have been working well until the latest updates, then some saved contacts only shows numbers only instead of number and name."
1,New update regarding channels and all are not seem good and it's irritating. Old version was good than this.
3,I do not enjoy the new update at all and the fact that you have too delete your status the longer way and the channels too which are unnecessary this is a degradation l wonder whats next.
1,"Please add option to post status in HD, for photos as well as videos. I don't know why WhatsApp is compressing photo quality when shared on status üòî"
1,Since the update I can't change my profile picture with out it crashing and force closing! Then app won't load until I restart my phone! Please fix
3,"These channels are important to me but now they are loading too much and not opening, that's my issue, I need those channels cos I track Economic data of my country please fix that!"
3,There is a major glitch in status section in which if we can open the status and back to the chat... Then the status music is running in backround.
2,The new placement for the emoji panel is just not it. It's really annoying to use. Please revert to the old one.
3,"Can you give the option that the client can choose where the emoji tabs can be? Like now the list is at the bottom , but make it that you as user can change it to top , cause i struggle with it being at the bottom"
1,"What's the main goal of this new update now, my contacts are now saved without name and I can't even use this app properly as usual üòî It's seems like those new features do not work on Android phone"
5,"All features are good but if we send a video to others or give a status , it's converted to lower quality, please update this feature."
1,"Very bad update, not suitable for everyone, it's loaded like Facebook social profile. Not good update . Should be replaced with another App like signal."
2,"Still useless updates, would still like to be able to choose who I have on WhatsApp instead of all our contacts... blocking people is slightly offensive, sometimes... Why can we not choose!!"
1,"I don't like status bar change to update, it's so annoying, whatsapp is private application for chatting don't allow this application to be social like we can follow someone etc Please remove that and turn it back to private üòä"
4,I wish the colours would be more distinctive. It's difficult to decifer between the green and blue if messages are read or not
1,Forwarding has become extremely lagging. It seems like mobile has stuck while I try to forward any important information. Why does this happen? Am I the only one to experience this?
4,Yeah it's a greatt in communication but only have one problem with itt it reduces the picture quality of statues pictures or video .....you really need to work on that but otherwise good app
1,"The app is super buggy and the pin message function is not even available with this version. Improve on this, the versions before were better !"
1,"I hate this app because when i make a custom ringtone, it doesn't work. It makes me feel wanted to delete Whatsapp. I hope you guys can fix this."

1,"The latest update for Channel üòî please find another way to place it, we don't have the search bar jn status nomore and on top of that after viewing a status now it will be hidden by new channels."
5,Dear Sir Can you please provide feature like higher resolution images and videos also in Status just like in chats you provided This feature need many people. So please do needful.
1,"Stop it, give us back the old Status system. Make a seperate tab for Channels, Status was so great tab all these years but naah You guys wanna make great things go terrible."
3,Update to the statuses page has messed up the experience. There should be an option to allow one to restore the previous layout.
1,I dont like this new update!!!! Why was the search button on the status update removed?? Please put it back...and the update should remain the way it used to be before and not horizontal
1,"This new update is very annoying I can't delete my own status update, can't even search for friends status, what's all this, give us the normal, usual and nicer version back"
1,"Update on 15 sept 2023....i reaalllyy am not a fan of how the new status section appear.Everthing is too facebook like.it was more original before updating.I hope you change it back in the next update,and putting channel and all is too unnecessarey and inconvenient."
1,I keep getting banned for no apparent reason. It's been the worst experience with this app plus it's the main communication media and with all makes it difficult. One star is not even deserved
1,This is for the new feature added as channels. How to remove channel showing in my WhatsApp? Please allow young generation and other people's to live their own life. What is the need of channels added as new feature? Atleast WhatsApp was available as a good medium for sending messages now you are also trying to consume others time and make money like other social media apps.Give or think about others well being
1,"Why notifications doesn't appear IN TIME?? Now even worsen: I no need channels!!! How to rid of them? Oh yes, another stupid new feature: keyboard emojis horrendous! I can give ZERO points for this app!!!"
1,Last update about status view and status viewrs list is very bad experience. Before update it's very comfortable to see and operate.
3,"Used to love the app, but absolutely detest the channels ! Don't like it, don't want it but can't delete it, I used to enjoy setting a status, but not anymore"
2,New features made this aap worst. It is same like Instagram without posts. And to many links. Good opportunity for devloper to create app like old WhatsApp. Downfall start for this app!!!
1,Worst experience in my life. I tried to update it in my laptop as it claimed that if not done it will expire. All my important documents are now gone after updating. This incident made me hate what's app and I am devastated now
4,Love that whatsapp keeps making changes and improving the app. One thing I hope can be included is folders to let us organize our chats.
3,"Hi everyone I'm enjoying the new WhatsApp update,but I think there should be need for search button on status resent updates and viewed updates,cuz it's making it difficult for find a particular status thanks."
1,The latest update is so worthless I don't like that my status section is changed into updates I don't like this feature at all please provide some options where we can close the update section and bring back status section as it is
1,"Upon scrolling up in an individual chat, after a couple gentle scrolls the chat skips wayy up to many hours, sometimes days. and then I have to scroll down drastically."
2,Nice app but while WhatsApp calling if I disconnect my Bluetooth buds and again try to connect the app isn't accepting my Bluetooth device mic and I have to cut the call and connect the Bluetooth device.
2,"Last month ,I block my best friend for making fun. Suddenly,I tapped the report button accidentally. Then our all messages deleted and was end to end encrypted. How can I get back our conversations? Our conversation was almost three years ."
5,What's App is better than other apps that do texting and video calls. I've been using it for over 10 years and it keeps getting better. I will never stop using this app.
5,"I love this app, it is the coolest, easiest,and fantastic app i have ever download it is reliable and fast even if the network is bad. It is one of the best chatting app.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
4,I have an Problem in whatsapp that is whenever I send multiple photos at a time I can deselect none of them nor can I stop them from sending . This a big problem for me please help.
5,"This very useful app for job's etc and this far far messages also send I like this app and WhatsApp inside I see new features edit messages,click the voice button then came video icon,etc So, Thank you very much WhatsApp üòä üôè ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ò∫Ô∏è üíñ üíï"
1,Dear whatsapp you are squaceing the throat of privacy by turn on screen shot and screen recording on your app please listen this issue seriously and remove this system .As like hotstar and pw and have a look on gb whatsapp also this one of the most concerned topic beacuse if we delete the message and we click on view once it doesn't work the man that is using gb whatsapp is able to open the deleted messages and view once any time anywhere where for many times
4,Amazing UI and all updates are unique. And one issue I faced that any text message is editable for 15 minutes then why Poll is not editable???ü§îü§îü§î
1,I would give only one star because I am facing very bad experience in status upload. All the videos pics are blurred. It's really annoying thing. Pls fix this issue
1,"the new update ruined the quality of my story even tho it's just 2 mb, the old one below 4 mb but the quality is still good. please bring back the new feature."
4,"Hello! I'm wondering why the recent WhatsApp update, which allowed message editing, hasn't been available yet, even though it was highly anticipated."
3,"Ever since I updated this app, it has been so annoying, wish I can add images so as to show whet exactly is wrong, and it makes my phone hang.."
1,Such a stupid app. It provides encryption for the backed up data but no way to recover it which doesn't make sense at all!
4,"This app is good , but I think you should add for each contact/chat a ""EMERGENCY CALL"" like it would show that: ‚ö†Ô∏è EMERGENCY CALL ‚ö†Ô∏è Blake is emergency calling you ""The Profile picture picture"" ‚Üë ‚ùå üìû Thank you if you read this WhatsApp üôè"
1,"I was forced to update(i dont want to update it), the lay out at status section is ugly with the so called channels and it's sore to the eyes, the emoji button is ugly too. Overall it is ugly and inconvenience."
3,The new updates option is so annoying. It really wasn't necessary. Can you please remove it or just add an option to hide that part
4,Great App except that calls are constantly dropping and reconnecting. Good voice clarity.I love rhis app.
3,"The previous updates spoiled the Mute concept. Notifications have been coming even though the conversation was muted. Muted means silent notification. Please, change this. We need to get silent notifications..."
5,amazing app but I am not able to create my own channel and only find channels option is available to me. please rectify the problem as soon as possible
1,Awful Experience... My whatsApp account ban due to spam.. After some day it is ban due to inactivity... Again Due to violating privacy policy.. WhatsApp just harassed me at all. They just ban my number without any reasons.. And reasons what they every time they tell me new reason. I'm tired of sending mails and request. Still my number is unable to use whatsApp. Almost weeks passed but i didn't get any solutions..
2,"Please can we get the status listed vertically again, horizontal is very inconvenient and discouraging üôèüèΩ, I promise to change it back to 5 stars if the review is considered."
1,Why is WhatsApp not allowing me to use WhatsApp!??? I even reinstalled it then too no change. It shows that I'm not using the *OFFICIAL WhatsApp app* It's so irritating!!!! Kindly sort out this prblm as soon as possible
1,"When posting videos on moment, the audio and vid dosent sync like how it use to be before the past couple of update."
2,"I don't like this new Idea of adding channels to WhatsApp, what makes it different from Facebook and twitter? I wish I could go back to the old version."
2,after recent update. Gif isn't working properly. when you search any gif and scroll down the search disappears and default gif comes. Hope this glitch gets fix soon
5,"It's a good app ...the only updates we need are three..... 1.See others when they are online 2.Allowed to change background for home screen to photo 3.Allowed to change font type, chat bubble colors and hide when viewed status PleaseüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ"
3,Please give an option to make folders for different groups. Like i have 3 college groups and 5 office groups. It would be so convenient to make separate folders for them.
4,Best app! But please add the schedule message feature. As that will a very good feature. YouTube also have this feature on the Community Posts and YouTube Videos.
2,"Please improve the quality of profile picture, whenever I put my HD picture in profile it get little bit blur and show poor quality of my picture which is actually not in real! PLEASE IMPROVE"
5,can please add one more option for status viewer searching option. it's was need very much for our contact important people was viewed or not imply searching it
1,"I have been trying to verify my account for almost 3 days now. Every time i try it says ""you recently try to verify this number please wait before trying"". And the support team didn't even reply to any mails."
5,"I can't send voice msg properly in my whatsapp....like I have recorded a 2 to 3 minutes msg..but when i send it...it is just for the 0.01 seonds...Although, my mobile recorder is working well but I have this problem from past 6 to 7 months.....Kindly suggest me something what should I do."
1,"I m not able to connect my number it shows me always as an error, it shows open official WhatsApp again and again, I m in a worst condition as my whole business is mostly depends on WhatsApp kindly rectify this problem it will be ur kindness thanku"
1,Is good when it comes to creating community group.. but I can no longer forward Pictures or message.. finding it difficult and is kind of anoying.. pls look into it
4,it is awesome....but after the new update it is not showing status contents properly and you should add showing blue ticks after reply and blaa blaa blaaa. thank you...
2,"Please remove the ""Channels"" feature which comes with new update. Don't make it Instagram. Leave WhatsApp as it was before with a clean interface."
5,Super excited by this applicationüòçthe new voice status is very extraordinary for us people who likes to talk a lot I want to Thank You Whatsapp Team...THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!!
1,I keep getting notifications of the past messages that were already sent to me and have been seen by me. I don't know what's the point in that. Please fix this bug.
5,I am using WA version 2.23.18.79 (latest) on my android phone. But Updates option is not appearing on top bar instead status is only coming. Can you guide.
1,The latest update is annoying can't find the stickers and the statuses can't be seen with the silly updates replacing it ....I have no use for the updates how do I get my statuses back
1,Please delete channel update...too irritating and i am not able to hide it ...keep WhatsApp simple as it has it's own identity and don't make too many changes.
4,This app is very great I mean the features but I would be very impressive if you can add some features from iphone like the iOS like when you select a text the rest messages become blur that would be very great thanks
1,"Damn it, they've screwed it up with their recent update. Now when I press the emoji icon, I can't see the box I type in and not only that but I can't send it neither while the emoji panel is up. Stop trying to fix something that isn't broken"
1,"Very bad and annoying new UI for emojis and stickers, it doesn't make sense and it's very buggy. Quite difficult to find what you are looking for."
5,"I think that WhatsApp is a great platform and is very user friendly. I have had a major problem with it, in that no notifications or calls would come through to my phone. I have to go into the app to check if I have had any missed calls and messages. I have just gone and changed all my different settings, so I hope that I have sorted it out now. If not I will have to contact Tech Support."
2,"Honestly, I'd prefer any other app at any time but the only reason i use WhatsApp is because everyone is using this app. This app has tonnes of glitches and they're not even trying to fix it. When i try to change my profile picture half of the pictures won't even show up ! Also I'm üíØ convinced that the developers won't even look into this or even reply to this because that's what they do"
3,"Guys , please add CHAT LOCK feature with phone pattern or password to unlock, only fingerprint is not enough as some part of the users still dont have devices which accept fingerprints , even i dont have a fingerprint accepting device which makes this features useless for me cuz it automatically turns off when i turn it on."
1,It quite frustrated when my important voice messages in whatsapp lost and can't be restored after reinstalling this app. even after doing backup earlier. audio and voice messages need to be backup too.
1,Pathetic! Been facing the issue where my contacts turned into phone numbers every time I'm able to check on WhatsApp statuses. It's Bizarre to see those numbers instead of the names you saved them in your phonebook . Updated the app twice. Reinstalled also nothing worked out.
1,I don't like the new update. WhatsApp was the only app where we can find privacy but now I don't know why it's following Instagram. Plz remove the new update. Even there is no option to search in the status tap.
2,"The voice note function in the ws keeps freezing on me. Whenever i tried to listen to voivcenotes, the volume will suddenly go down and it stops playing all on its own."
1,"Screenshots I used to be able to take screenshot of my contacts pictures. But now it says disabled by your admin. I had to uninstall what's app, and reinstall. But now I've lost the option to screenshot my messages with friends. So annoyed üò†"
1,"Since my WhatsApp updated by itself with all unnecessary channels which I don't use, the WhatsApp give me headache, meaning click to open then cut off, click to open then cut off. What's happening,please fix it. Thanks."
1,This latest update is horrible. It keeps on banning me without violating any rule. They always say we FLAGGED your account by mistake but keep on doing the same thing. When you are typing your text goes beyond keyboard so that you can not even read it before you send
1,"It has many problems, for example, no clouds, you have to download a file then send it. Search dose not work perfect. And many silly issues üòî"
1,"Subject: Request to Improve Status Quality for Pictures and Videos on WhatsApp Dear WhatsApp Support Team, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to address a concern that many users, including myself, have been experiencing regarding the quality of pictures and videos in WhatsApp statuses. While WhatsApp continues to be a preferred platform for sharing moments with friends and family through statuses, there seems to be an issue with the degradation of picture and video quality when t"
3,Now we all need a user id for whatapp as well. It's quite annoying to share your contact details for temporarily based work . I don't wanna share my number to anyone. We all know whatsapp have a very unique feature of sharing files and video much faster than any other app and also it need very low maintainance
1,"Books With correct grammar Picture App Terbaik Google Audio Images Deep Scan & translate Microsoft Word Article All filters Search Results Translation result Malay English Dohhh.. Hi whatsapp, after the new update, please do a search to see the status we want. It's hard like this, scroll up and down here. What is the function of the channel??? I am not interested in this channel. Please make a choice for those who like the channel and those who don't like the channel"
1,"WhatsApp new update doesn't let you screenshot one view pictures. PLEASE BRING THAT BACK. Also now, when videocalling the camera automatically gets put sideways and fills with an ugly background colour instead of keeping the image straight covering all the screen"
1,My account is being controlled and used by other without my permission. I requested Whatsapp support team. They only ask me to fill a feedback form and nothing. At least provide a customer support number to reach you quickly so the problem should be resolved at the earliest.
1,The new feture for emojis and what not is so freenik annoying it completely destroyed the experience and flow. I credibility annoying even my misses stopped using emojis when she was the queen of using them just completely ruined it. I hate when companies do that. I want to be able to switch new and old features to my liking. We are grown-ups for (swearing) sake why are tou making changes with out our approval.
1,"New contact is not showing no matter how many times I saved it in various storage options (phone, simcard, gmail) and recent files sometimes can't be (re)downloaded with notificatipn ""ask sender to re-send again"" bullcraps!"
2,"Great app, I've been using Whatsapp since a long time ago, but recently Whatsapp web keep going out of sync (i have to re link the device almost every hour) and won't show new messages, this really hurt my productivity. Please fix this issue"
1,"I want to login but unable to receive SMS and call too. When I tap send code olby SMS or call, I received notification that currently we are unable to call on your number please try after 1 hour."
3,So far the app is part solid....no complaints really except in the new update where they changed the emoji and sticker interface....it's kinda slow and annoying to use...would be better if you can go back to how it was
2,"Please fix the stupid bug that dims the screen and lowers the volume of a voice note playing back. If you accidentally cover the screen slightly, it thinks you have put the screen to your ear. So annoying."
3,"The new updated version has some issues while copying text outside WhatsApp and pasting in a chat.. the texts from WhatsApp can be copied and pasted but something outside WhatsApp can't be copied and pasted and we are finding it troublesome , especially at workplaces.."
3,"App is really good, but one more privacy option have include. PIN or password must be include on starting of the app. There were no app passwords in most of the old phones. Hope your team will consider this."
1,"WhatsApp used to be one of my favourite apps, but with each update is getting worse. First of all it reduces quality of all the pictures or videos we put in the status. Dude I am a photographer, my good photos gets really messed up because of your data limitation. Also, why I can't share my WhatsApp Status to someone who didn't saved my number. I mean it's my WhatsApp so it should be MY CHOICE. Also, we can't send big files on WhatsApp and that is too bad. Please make WhatsApp just like old one"
4,"Awesome Secure App üëè I've noticed one thing that needs to be change is that we have only only 5 contacts in th sharing option. If you increase it to 20 contacts, then we can easily send a message to multiple people on occasions like Eid's and others."
1,"Always blocking my whatsapp! I can't longer access it anymore! Worse of all, this app has issues verifying my number! Which i find annoying! Each time i try requesting for a call or sms it always fails! Cuz this app will often refer me to another app to sign in. And the sign in process is also a big failure too."
1,"All of my messages on WhatsApp suddenly disappeared, and could not be recovered even though I had backup it before. Very bad."
1,"Been good in the past, but now its becoming more buggy with each update, even the uploaded status is buggy üò≠ I can't upload a full 30s video it's ways lagging glitchy and stops not even halfway through. And the quality of the status update is too poor, got me deleting the statuses, it's sad"
1,"I truly see unnecessary the ne ""updates"" tab on Whatsapp for CHANNEL SEARCHING. Please remove. Whatsapp doesn't need that when we already have Facebook, Instagram, messenger. Please fix I really hate it"
4,"This app is most helpful day today life daily. I'm very very appreciative your interested updateds. I expected from you the call profile settings, before the update the when call profile picture show in whole screen as big clear picture the middle of the screen but after the update DP show as smallüòû that update very very disappointed to me , otherwise your last seen update, stutes update, profile update these updates very very like to me."
2,Edit : changing 5 star to 2 star. Why compressing the video to reduce the quality. Increase the limit atleast. What is the need of status if we can't upload high quality videos. Now you have removed the option to forward the video directly too.. shameful.
1,"""Channels"" is terrible. Suggests inappropriate channels and people who I have zero interest in and do not care about. This is not Instagram. Will use different messaging service if there's no way to disable ""channels"""
5,Love that you can send long videos and many photos a once. You can cal internationally for free. My favorite app.
3,Location sharing feature shows places listed on foursquare instead of the maps I used (G Maps). Will appreciate the update adding G Maps as source of places. Thanks üëçüëçüëç
1,The app is nice and great but every 2 months or so it starts acting up telling me i can't acess my account due to spam and after sending review it still takes about a week to get back to normal please fix this for me it is very annoying and it makes me want to stop using the app because i cant keep losing my messages and chats every 2 months. Also after this recent update my account has refused to be logged in it keeps telling me to use official whatsapp is this not the official whatsapp?.
4,Great app I feel there should be a feature to udo deleted media and voice mails but asides that the screen sharing is a great feature
4,"When I upload videos to my status, they're blurry and the audio and video are outta sync. Please fix this"
1,I have been following the terms and conditions and downloaded the official app from Google play store but still it's showing I need to download from official website. I have written emails but still my problem is not solved yet. I have been using WhatsApp since a very long time but now am very disappointed that my problem is not getting rectified.
1,"Can't put high-quality status cause it's compressing so much even though the video is under 15mb, like it's not even 14mb but in this new update whatsapp making it directly 4mb... I always keep the video ratio 16:9 and bitrate under 5000 but now in this new update it sucks"
3,"App is great , enables me to contact everyone like my family , friends, clients etc.. you can never go wrong with this app you can connect or keep in touch with anyone, whenever and wherever"
3,"I found a bug. When i ends the call it displays ""just know"" message in the call section but it remains just know until i close the app from background."
1,"It used to be good until it randomly started to ban me from using it every single hour without me even knowing what have I done. It just says that my account is not allowed to use WhatsApp or whatever. If whatsapp doesn't fix this, this could be the problem it's gonna lose lots of its customer, thank you."
1,"I just updated the app and now I can't open it because it keeps crashing, this is really annoying because I can't get through to any of my contacts now and I can't even back it up if I decide to clear data. Please fix this because I wouldn't want to just switch to Telegram like that."
1,"I use WhatsApp for messages..for the recent update,i dont like the channel's update status"" appear with our contacts update ..its disturbing me. Atleast give us an option to hide the ""Chanel' Status Update"".. dont make WhatsApp like Facebook, WeChat which is crowded with ads, unnecessary things or can we say one stop centre apps. Thanks"
1,"Its way too hard to switch phone with this, just be carefull. The security is good but sometimes its way too stupid, why is it so hard to transfer chat? Create a ""transfer chat"" button and its done, no need to do 7 steps this and that."
4,whtsap is awesome app but we should put one more extra privacy that privacy is that some unknown person message that message should be kept in the request of accept or rejected option should be given I request that this update should be there on the whtsap some unknown person msg should be kept in the accepting or rejecting place not in the inbox thnks plz accept my this request
1,This app is becoming useless and irritating We have so many platforms for social media just leave at least one place clean and calm ..... Not every app has to be for timepass and timewaste !!!
1,"Since this morning, i have not been recieving any messages from anyone. When i send a message to someone only single tick appears, but the recipient is able to recieve the message. Kindly check and address this issue asap."
2,last update brought an annoying bug where I can no longer select an emoticon; it will instead click thru and go to the chat box. annoying
3,"Since the WhatsApp has been updated everything went mess .In status column it shows celebrities WhatsApp I'd that I did not like, please remove this feature . although nearly everything is good only"
4,"I noticed on the 'update' part which was formerly 'status' I am not able to search updates to view which wasn't like that before, It would be nice you bring that back."
1,I can't delete messages. Happened all of a sudden. Long press stopped working on messages. I am able to hold and slide for reply can't delete it. Kindly fix this issue asap. Happened on Oppo F11.
4,"really useful, works well and its generally easy to use. but the emoji bar update??? just unnecessary. why make it so difficult to do something that was easy and didnt need to change? its infuriating because it doesnt even work half the time üòí"
1,So my whatsapp has been disturbing a lot recently. It says your whatsapp has been logged out from this device. And this happened multiple time. I literally changed 3 sim and i formated my phone once recently. It was fine and today suddenly same thing happened again. I need my whatsapp back as there is many important files about work and all. Please fix it. Its giving me mental trauma now
3,"Great messenger service but the update with the emojis has created a super annoying interface. The emoji screen is really small so you can hardly see them and it keeps closing, mixing with the keyboard. Please fix this!"
5,When it comes to UPI esp. the on boarding part WA is far and away the worst I have ever used. Zero issues with other apps actually. Edit: The issue was resolved sometime later.
4,"Should add non compress status. When i upload a video on my status, it quality is really bad cause compressed into small size Make it an option to upload on best quality"
4,Hi W/app team... givin'ya four stars 'CZ I'm facing a problem after updating your app: W/app is all about Sooper encrypted connection from any corner of the world. It's a worldwide connection app but .... I have to point out the one problem I'm facing that About Gallery-pics filters ... After updating my what's app App ... I lost all operation to apply them. Kindly pay attention. And provide us the feature again to apply filters.
1,"This damn thing doesnt receive messages sometime.The person sending the message will see 2 ticks as our internet will be connected.But as for us the receiver the message wont reach us instead there will be a pop up in the notification bar saying-""Searching for new messages"".Please fix this stupid bug.I missed many important messages due to this bug.Fix this ASAP"
1,"The new WhatsApp update of these channels is very disgusting. I wish it would change as soon as possible. As for the advantages of WhatsApp now, it is very nice, but I wish the channels were canceled, as they are completely unnecessary and disgusting üëçüèª."
5,I've come back to review my rating. I can see my last comment about message editing is done. So kudos to you guys. I'm eating 5 star Very Good application. Please kindly work on editing message feature. We prefer to edit rather than delete. Thanks. Good job.
2,"Since the last update, I have no sound for outgoing or in coming messages, and everything is switched on."
4,"Best messaging app ever, but it'd be cooler if it had a STATUS REPOST feature. Rather than just downloading the status saver, and if it can download videos or pictures you viewed in other peoples status."
5,"One of the best apps hands down. People can say whatever they want about mark, but he understands business.. I hope he looks back on this, and realize he isn't hated.. its just that he's waaaay more talented than he understands. He doesn't need all this vr stuff.. we're happy with him being the leader of socials, as long as he respects the privacy of others. But mark, don't give up.. just go beyond, because I STILL am addicted to your platforms, to this day. You're talented, remember that."
5,"WhatsApp is great and all but mine has a problem that's been bugging me for a while now. Everytime I try to upload a media on my status, the thumbnail doesn't load and it ends up not being posted. Please fix this as soon as possible."
1,I do not like the update feature of whatsapp because its so much irritating when we see someone's status it just appears and we like whatsapp to be limited to our friends and family I dont want whatsapp to become instagram please remove this feature.
5,"I have used this App almost 20yrs now on many devices have been very happy with it. I'm also very grateful for the respect you showed me recently. Was having problem with my device couldn't connect with my internet service, had to use some other device. I understand disconnecting the device and with just a minor verification that it was I doing the movement, all went on without a problem. Was able to fix my phone, logged back on to this App. With the phone, no problems after that. Thank You"
1,"Its very irritating when developers change the whole UI/environment of apps. And its now 3rd time when whatsapp developer makes it more worst to handle imozys rather than easing the use of it. And its make no sense to do so. The gif was already there, stickers was already there. They Just tried to make it more complicated experiments üòÇnow its time to switch better messanging apps‡•§"
4,16 the August 2023.. Now a days most of the people send their invitation like Marriage/ Birthday / Aniversary / etc.. We could Not remember the dates until unless some one will remember to check the message to posts long back... I would like to suppose to add new feature in the what's app that is like Calender or Reminder or notes feature. This way we can add a notes or add remainders or when they sent invite will directly add into the reminders... Thank you
3,"The new sticker tray is terrible, has such a lag which is really irritating when you're sending a long message or want to add emojis throughout the message, the previous design was much more user friendly."
1,Improve the quality of the photo and video. This application now getting worst. Don't build the channel because we don't need it. Please be yourself as before. Don't try to be like the other apps. You just need to fix what's on people opinion. Don't be selfish bro. Somehow you update something that is not important. More updates more worst. This is not only my opinion but also the others. Just improve something that's wrong. I really mean it. That's so annoying.
3,"This app is wonderful. It is so easy to use, infact it is a very good way to communicate.. I would like to say that if you add a feature to edit the written chats/captions/status, means to resend it.... Because sometime we send a message which is full of typo/typos.üòÑ I would also like to have a feature - delete for everyone for ever, what I mean to say is that ""delete for everyone"" option becomes disable after a time.üò∂ And then we can't delete that message. THANK YOU üòÉ"
1,Some times my texts are not delivered. I am facing this problem quiet frequently even though my internet connection is stable. Toll bar in below
3,There is a bug. Whenever I receive a call from unknown number then it doesn't show up in the call log. When I receive the call from same number 2nd time it starts showing.
1,New updated screwed up the voice and video call. With full 5G cellular network and upto 300mbps wifi. Still it reconnects. WHY!
2,"Date and time of messages shown year 1998, all new messages sent go to bottom of chat list. Remain until now. Beside messages in all chats that use timer disappear and new messages does not sent, just disappear in seconds!!!!"
1,What is going on with WhatsApp huh!!? Why did you guys add the channel on the WhatsApp are you guys competing to YouTube? You guys should know that it is a messaging app and we want a simple easy and reliable messaging app. It is an assault on the senses I don't normally write reviews but the monstrosity that this is got me here and here I am absolutely nothing make sense the colours the channels the updates. I just wanna say that don't do it again and change it ASAP.
1,What nonsense is this?? All of a sudden my media files says not available I I have 30 GB free space available. No external memory installed. I have just created dual profile and was working fine until yesterday.
1,"It's something wrong with WhatsApp from yesterday. I can not even open it for a moment. When I click on it, it just jump out very fast. It says there is bug in it. I cleared chash several times but it hasn't fixed. What do I have to do now? There is no update here either. ü§î"
1,"At first I thought it was my phone but I noticed it was only the WhatsApp app that was the only one with the issue. Ever since I updated my WhatsApp, it has been so terrible using it, it hangs a lot, either while viewing a status, texting, or trying to even open a chat to begin with."
1,"Why must you ruin a useful interface. Discouraging to update all together. Big L on this one, new interface is bland , boring, and un useful. Things are better at the top you guys are designateing functionality to the bottom."
4,Edit: seems to have been made somewhat easier! Adding people is nearly impossible. There's no simple way of just adding people. I'm not sure how I managed to do it in the past but it's frustrating and a waste of time.
5,App is excellent but I beg you don't make channels because there will be no difference between telegram and WhatsApp that's why I am saying please don't make channels and please give permission to group admins to delete videos from everyone at any time and any month aur year
1,No support for WiFi android tablets. There is no real reason for this gap. No support for wear os calls even when tree service is lte and has own number. In short support for Android ecosystem is really bad. Would recommend using non Meta solution or maybe iOS
1,Please at least read our opinion Whatsapp!! I love using this and I think it's part of my phone already but the fact that the new update shown some channel is quite annoying and disturbing please bring back the old one! ASAP!! I HATE SEEING THAT CHANNEL STUFF we are not busy body to follow other channels thank you
2,"After a recent update, incoming or outgoing calls on Whatsapp are not reflected in the call list. I had save the person's phone number, but due to this bug, I couldn't. Please fix this"
2,"The quality is ""ok"" but the app itself hangs up my calls, lags, makes me reconnect out of nowhere and makes me have to make a new call. WhatsApp fix this now. My friend hates it too were both writing bad reviews right now at the same time. The new screen share update kinda sucks ngl"
3,Pleass whatsapp...you're getting there with the new updates...but one thing..we want our keyboards to pull up the moment we open chats just like how apple is. It's already getting more smoother in the recent update. And I love it. We just need that keyboard pull immediately we open unread chats to reply. That's all. Thanks.
2,"Creates too much backup data. App has become unstable, when sending a ""voice note"" it freezes then wants to send a gif as well. Have to close app & reopen to continue"
1,"It seems like the app developers are stubborn. You should ADD a feature to know if you're blocked by a user. It should NOT RING when you call a blocked user. Also, we want to use 2 numbers for what's app on the same device instead of having two cell phones. Some of us travel to different countries so we need an option of Two numbers on the same device. Also Timed Messages should be 48 Hours , 1 Week, 2 Weeks, 30 Days , 90 Days."
4,"I like this app all in all, but one thing that disturbes me is the clarity decrease while uploading status.... I would like if the quality of the vedios i put status on dsn't reduce...ü•πü§å"
3,Why it needs 3 backups at a time? It consumes over 5 gb space in memory. Also the app is crashing a lot today. I have over 20GB phone memory and I tried all the available remedies but the issue still persist. 7 sept 2023.
3,"Cool app, it's just annoying that the sensor turns your phone dark whenever you tilt it slightly and the app didn't give you the option to turn it off."
1,"Latest update has a lot of issues, can't go to emojis it just goes blank everytime üò§. Can you please fix whatever issues you're having with the latest update, or rather don't bother having updates until you're 110% sure that there'll be no issues"
1,Unsatisfied The latest update on WhatsApp status is not necessary... I can't skip to my status and view the one I want to view without viewing all. Removing search option for WhatsApp status is not helping us at all. This is one of the not so necessary updates Please how can I go back to the other version of WhatsApp?
1,"The new update is terrible. Not worth updating. They are making WhatsApp like twitter and Instagram. It is meant for personal contacts. I don't need to be seeing. What other people are doing that's why Instagram was created, together with threads.. . Kindly downgrade it cause this doesn't make sense"
4,"""WhatsApp is my top choice for messaging, but the frustrating drop in image and video quality when posting statuses needs improvement. Hoping for a fix soon!"""
5,"Amazing app, amazing updates. But imagine if with the Voice Note status, comes the ability to share other people's in-chat Voice notes to your status ü§Øü§Ø People would use that more than the status one. I'm just saying ü§≠"
4,"This App has become worse now. My account got locked minimum 10 times in 48 Hrs telling I have violated some terms & conditions. Even though I send very less messages there, I asked somany times to tell me what I violated. But the team is not ready to tell me the reason. Even after getting activated the account from their side it will be locked within 30 mins."
1,"Add a status save option. This app feels empty without it. It's irritating getting to a point if downloading a ""status saver"" instead of having that in one app."
4,"""Monthly"" Broadcast option maybe to Groups & Chats? So I would like a way if possible by the developers, to be able to send out a monthly broadcast on 3 specific dates each month. If this could be done it would help tremendously. Thanks for the service thus far still guys!"
1,"The last update is broken! Can't send GIFs, sometimes doesn't detect my SD card, and there's this empty space that appears when sending messages T___T"
5,"Everything is okay but i don't like the feature of channels which is new. I don't need these kind of features. We have insta, fb and many more to folliw someone. Please remove it."
1,"My phone spazzed out on me, probably due to the latest app I installed that wasn't right in some way, and I had to do a factory reset. Now Whatsapp won't let me install the app."
1,"1) I make calls(without internet) using earpod and it's usually clear, but on WhatsApp the receiver will never hear what I'm saying. Makes me feel like my earpod is bad but it's not. 2) Stop playing videos immediately after I stop viewing a status. 3) Now I can't send multiple files like before using the ""DOCUMENT"" option. When you fix these, please give a feedback so I can update. Regards."
3,"Overall app is good but the only thing that causes trouble is that if someone takes a screenshot of your chat or your pic,you does not even know ,and such things make privacy issues..kindly have a look at my point.. thanks üòä"
1,On the chat section it keepa on asking me if I want to create a community at the top. I have to manually click to get this away. This is so utterly annoying. Cant find a way to get this off.
3,Everything is good but you should make a hidden button for locked chat because if someone open WhatsApp the person can see locked chat option on the top easily...if anyone can see locked chat option than what is hidden
5,This WhatsApp is a good app and can be trusted to our selves. But one thing is to know that this is only the messenger lite which can make video call and texing voice calls and voice records this is a good app i been using this app from year's and it didn't give any problems at all..!!! (Malika akram)
1,"Sticker section in the updated interface is horrible. Who decided that this is a good idea? Updates are supposed to make it easier for your users, the update is creating more unnecessary steps and the opposite of convenience."
2,This app is nice and it helps with chating. The new features are also amazing! But the reason for my low star rating is because my account kept getting banned again and again for no apparent reason. I had to write a email everyday to the WhatsApp support team to unban it. This is the only thing I found annoying.... otherwise the app is great.
2,"New regression: my Android 10, OneUI 2.5 - a mobile warns me of a Horrible battery drain in the background of the current version of Whatsapp causing that (asof 2023-08-23). Also lost packets during calls, voice lost for 1-3 seconds - Please inspect and fix. Thank you"
1,"I don't like the update. I prefer the old one which is I can delete the status easily, I can share it easily and don't have annoying channel there. The channel doesn't seem functional to me. Annoying actually for whatsapp to do this. Edit: Eiii SO STUPID AH. NOW I CAN'T BARELY DELETE MY OWN STATUS AFTER MY VIDEO ERROR TO UPLOAD. EDIT: EH REALLY AHH STUPID. I ACCIDENTALLY SEND FLAG EMOJI INSTEAD OF DELETE EMOJI."
3,"It is a good app , but for some days it is not showing me any status, it disappears everyone's status, I don't know why it is happening plz resolve it's issue"
1,"I have tried everything to register my number , uninstall the app , format the phone ,tried on different phones but not able to register my number . Same error everytime "" you need ot install install the official verison "" I have downloaded the WhatsApp from the playstor but still same error and no one is helping on that .worst customer support"
1,The app is fine but its very annoying that the quality of my photos decrease GREATLY when posted via whatsapp status. Annoying.
1,"For the past few days, if anyone called me on this app. It will ring but I can't answer it what show for me to answer don't come up and when I uninstall the app and re install the app I lost all my text and it did not help me with the problem with calling. If anyone called me I can't answer the call. I don't know what's going on? If this is deliberately sabotage hacking!!!"
5,Everything is good but you can add poll feature on status which can help us to take opinion from the contacts. Thanks
1,"Since a few days I have been receiving messages from some doubtful numbers about job offers in which they send a link and ask to long click on the link and reply 1 to accept the job offer, one of the numbers was from a foreign country. I request WhatsApp.Inc to take steps against these people,I didn't ask for a job and these numbers are very suspicious."
1,Very bad experience.. Most times glitch happens.. Calls get drop video gets stuck even when there is high speed network. I really suggest moving from WhatsApp to other messaging apps.
3,"An exceptional app. Always has been. Now you change the voice recording tab? Where is it? If something is not giving anyone issues and people love it, LEAVE IT ALONE!"
1,"suddenly, all whatsapp files (media, pictures, videos, etc..) disappeared from my phone gallery and i dont have any access to it. noting that i have very imporfant files that refers to my work."
5,It's an excellent app. Can you please make it possible to upload songs or music as WhatsApp status? This would be really great. Yhanks
3,"When I post a video on my status update, the video stutters and hangs (halfway through), this has been the case for the past 4 months"
1,"I cant believe i just lost my account. Everytime i want to log in, there will be this message ""use official whatsapp app"" I delete the app and download again, multiple times. Still out of no avail Whatsapp still all my data, files and media."
1,"Please give us option to remove channel suggestions, it's very uncomfortable, it's like someone invading your private space.. I'm using WhatsApp to avoid seeing some irrelevant celebrity on my feed, now all I'm seeing it's just, some dumb artist and some lowlife insta models channels...."
1,"very disapointed.. especially at restoring for a new phone. very useless feature that called backup to google drive, if we can't use it or it always stuck. useless backup options."
1,No service the voice sound horrible cuts off and sounds robotic then the phone calls never conect or hang up unexpectedly its really bad and it saves my contacts whit a diferent name i cannot delete contacts these does not work at all i am goin to delete it i need to know how i try to re install and it goes to 97% that its all does not respond now at all iam trying to delete my account
3,Hi Whatsapp It is a highly recommend suggestion by people and me make your privacy policy strict so that no one is allowed to do screen recording while using WhatsApp. You must definitely think on it and put it on high priority . Thank you WhatsApp and WhatsApp team
1,"Status quality has dropped badly , it's been a while since this started but whatsapp never seems to fix thier status photo and video quality drop issues"
1,"it says my account is banned because I violated their rules, but I didnt do anything as my usage is very basic. My account was hacked since 25 days or more, so i couldnt even use it. I patiently waited for its cooldown time of 7 days. When reinstalling, it says use official app from play store, and i downloaded it from playstore only. I tried contacting customer care via Email, but they are replying with unrelated solutions. Very poor customer support, What should I do? Please help!"
3,"I gave Whatsapp three stars bcs I wasn't able to view my friend's update even though they didn't hide their updates from me..fix this problem asap..and what's wrong with the 20 January 1970 on everyone's bio date?also, when I'm updating an updates and it's already been 2 or more than a hour it will suddenly said 'just now'...ur updates just keep getting worst"
5,"It's Totally Good,But The problems is I accidentally left my own group, even though I just left another community, but why did I suddenly leave alone? That's what makes me confused,and please if the owner(Creating their own groups groups) Enable the Remove/Kick for Owner, Causes Those who are not the owner of the group can remove/Kick the original owner of the group from their own group (I hope you Understand it Causes I'm Bad At Grammarüôè,and Notice this,I need it For another update So much)"
2,the new keyboard animation switching to emojis and new layout where the stickers are is absolutely terrible. we got used to the old one now its just super slow and unnecessary. please bring the older layout back
1,It keeps on telling me I need to download the real WhatsApp..... like it's this type real one ........ It's getting pretty frustrating...... like some one needs to help me.
1,"I had a big problem when I used the application for the first time. It was very good, but now when my friends message me, the messages do not reach me, but I can send them."
4,Voice message should support bluetooth device for mic. Currently it uses thrme onboard mic. Whatsapp uses the bluetooth mic and earphone for calls but uses phone's mic for voice messages. This can be easily addressed. Usecase is scenario when onwards mic is not working.
4,"Great, love the new features but the app keyboard keeps lagging and it disappears for a second every minute or so, if that. I'm not sure why but I have to restart my phone for it to work again. Not sure if it is a Samsung thing or a WhatsApp thing but please look into it üëçOne recommendation too, every time a file i.e images, pdf etc is downloaded, a pop up asking to delete or save the file after listening/watching/looking at it etc would be an amazing addition."
2,The new 'updates' lacks a search icon for fast search through status and channels and this is very uncomfortable.
1,"I unable to access my account and I'm using the official app. I keep receiving the ""you are using unofficial app""error message yet I downloaded the app from play store"
2,I use this app and threema. It just lacks security of threema. It's better then the rest but it lacks security of Swiss based company.
5,Ever since the update my voice notes selectively record sound or just doesn't record sound at all. It's so frustrating!! Update: I updated my phone software and everything is fine. My bad.
4,This is very useful and good because of its easy access. But its security terms can easily be violated too. My account has been banned because of changing of phone and number. I hope you can help me solve this problem
3,"For all of its great capabilities, you can't schedule messages. It also has URL previews on WhatsApp Web failing to load consistently. Will update as these get fixed."
1,"I'm facing bug these days , whenever i open whatsapp all the statuses disappear immediately after once shown and for almost 2 or 3 seconds all the contacts saved appear without name with numbers only . i need you to fix these things as soon as possible ."
1,"Awful updates each and everytime. Its just that i need it otherwise I'd have deleted it already. Its as useless as the updates keep on coming, useless updates. I would have given a zero star."
1,This platform keeps on blocking my number even if I send them an email they don't respond it is a very bad thing.... And just imagine most of my communications are done here üòû.... Mxiium.. Improve your app and put it together....
3,Please please please remove the latest update from 13/09/23 it's really ruining my experience with the app. It's impractical and unuseful. Channels are totally unnecessary. Thank you
4,The app and features are really good. But it misses the function to manage stickers in the app
2,"I thought my phone was the problem but it turned out to be the app. Everytime I'm making call, the screen will just turn black and I cannot even turn on the camera coz I can't see anything on the screen. Same when people calls me, it will immediately turn the screen black"
4,I feel like I don't have control over keeping my messages when other people can turn on disappearing messages and my messages are deleted. I like to keep some of my messages. If a person turns on disappearing message this should only be applicable to them and not affect the other person or persons in a group. I feel totally manipulated and out of control. In a group only the group leader should be able to turn this on. If one wants disappearing messages they should only be able to turn theirs on
1,App logged me out now all past settings and chat will not load. Continuously saying waiting for this msg for all past chat. Assuming it's due to update as worked fine before.
3,Listen me up there's a problem going on in India... While chatting with someone I cant see them online as well as they don't see me. And no we are not enable/disable any option. It's irritating and it's going on for several weeks now try to resolve it please.
3,"Tho WhatsApp is a nice media with lots of new updates, I recently realized my chats keep closing after certain activities like checking the profile, taking a screenshot and editing it, etc"
4,"Great app. Please, could you add a feature that enables us to block (not mute) the WhatsApp stories of select contacts without having to delete their numbers or block their chats completely. This would be great"
2,"Hey can you guys make the stickers arrangements more confusing? Ever since the update, the stickers tab are automaticaly referring to random favorite section after we tap a sticker, except thats not my favorite sticker/nor the recent or the sticker that i usually use. Very helpful to piss someone off, thank you."
4,"WhatsApp fix your privacy policy and update it..If someone talks to someone, it doesn't show busy or waiting, even if someone calls without entering inside WhatsApp Calling does not show his last seen or online..main thing is waiting or busy option while talking turn it on..its request.A lot of people are getting into this stuff because of it"
2,I have good experience before new update come. Butbin this new update in status whatapp bring a features to follow some one this feature makes whatapp unsafe and unsecure app in feature it effect and can be hack by hackers what'sapp should know feature problem by analysis . Please remove new update features from normal whatapp it's make us owkward and unsafe
5,Any chance for pinning more groups or contacts at the top of chat. It was very usefull for me. Regarding the shift of the tabs to the bottom I'm still not used to it. Will get the hang of it I guess.
4,Everything is good in this app but sent message editing is wrong. People gonna miss use this option. I request you please remove this update.
1,My account has been blocked and restarted from the last 15days without my any misuse and I am not getting a valid reason for this blockage.So please provide proper reason for this stoppage so that I become aware of the main problem.Since I am not getting any response from your side it is becoming difficult to understand the matter.
2,"Ever since the last update dropped, suddenly the upload speed of Stickers, Images, Gifs, ETC has been very slow, took I have great internet speeds but still didn't help. Please help resolve this issue!"
4,The app is good. I 've been using it for some good time but there is this time when it has started stopping suddenly every time I try to clean up some of its caches. Don't know whether it normal. Think the developers should explain to me.
2,After the new update I've realised my status videos are trimmed to a certain point where I send then after sending it plays like for only 5 seconds...please fix this
3,The app is good but you have to fix this status bug or whatever it is. After commenting on a video status and closing the app the video still plays in the background.
4,"Attaching multiple files to share on another app is not available. We need to save it and then from file manager, you can send it from the app which you want but it will great if we can send it directly from WhatsApp chat itself."
1,"The new update is terrible..which says updates instead of stories, whatsapp is the only app for internal contacts limited people now you guys introduced channels which is completely disaster..I even can't uninstall the update too"
4,"I have tried several times inputting my number again after reinstalling my Whatsapp to no avail. Also sent an sos email to your service. No verification came from sms and call. Please help me remedy this matter soon. I have some important contacts that I can only reach here since its the only messenger I use to contact them. Security and reliable app. Thank you so much. *change number/inputting number problems *no code received, neither sms nor call"
1,New features is too bad.Why we are following the celebrities Channel in WhatsApp. People need privacy. Just cancel the new features what it's show in WhatsApp Status. Really new features is very bad.
4,After recent update whenever I try to send a voice message the interface gets stuck and message doesn't get recorded and whole app is freezed . Can't do anything but to force stop it and open it again...
1,Really irritated with whatever the hectic is going on with WhatsApp. I can't type a message without it lagging and when I try send a message it basically types the message twice. Please address this issue.
1,What is wrong with whatsapp the new update is worst i cant play the voice massages kindly fix it i cant send voice but cant open other person voice note it shows only read but trying to click on it its not playing fix it i will give 5 star again
2,"After the new updating I can't share videos & uploading my status. It keeps on saying Can't send this video, try another one. It keeps on selecting what I send or share & it's annoying!"
2,"""WhatsApp isn't optimised for the latest version of Android. Screen touches may be delayed or not recognised."" Got a 'sending reply' pop up that stayed there for 17 minutes and didn't let me type anything. FIX IT, NOW."
5,"My experience is meanly based on sending videos, sending texts,getting informations and sharing ideas with friends and workmates."
1,I am not happy with using WhatsApp. I don't know how this is possible but when I updated the app for some reason every data and information was deleted and erased. I need my stuff back it is important and I must get it back. Even the backup option did not help. WhatsApp please do something about this and return my deleted info.
1,"Got a notice that WhatsApp was due to update 31 July 2023.i tried to update and now can access WhatsApp. Said it doesn't recognize my number and then it says I'm using 2x samsungs, I dnt. My phone is a Huawei p50. Battling my butt off to get it sorted. But no avail. I always update my phone and app. So I dnt understand why WhatsApp is doing this. It's ridiculous. And then you get forced to rate this app.. üòîü§¨"
1,"Everytime I posts any status, the video & image quality is lower than the original ones, and I have the latest version of the what's app too but still facing the same issues from few months... I contacted the help centre also but no positive response received timely...!!"
3,This updates disturbing the UI bcz when i click on emoji button for selecting any emoji so my text box and emoji section they go far away i.e. there is a big gap between both. So please fix it.
5,"Awesome app! Some emoji suggestions: Opposite wing, Full body pigeon, Cup of water, Cereal (with milk), Potted cactus, Cats of multiple patterns (like calico, stripes etc), Round glasses, Full body crow, oh and pls fix the yt video player, it still keeps glitching and resising the screen so I can't watch it."
2,"Hey! I don't know what happened to my whatsappp because whenever I try to open it up with my phone number they say that according to your account it looks you're not using official whatsapp and once I install it again it's the same thing they bring for me,so I'm really suffering with this problem, so please i would love your help. Thanks"
1,"Samsung Galaxy A53 5G and WhatsApp call notification problem When the phone is in sleep mode or the display is dark for a while. When someone calls on WhatsApp, it doesn't ring and as a result, the incoming call gets missed. On the other hand, it shows my phone status as ""Calling"" instead of ringing to the caller. My each incoming call is missed. Anybody facing this problem on A53 5g?"
1,The new emojie update is terrible. Hate it. So complecated and lagged. Unpleasant to use. The quality of the images is terrible and when I want to upload a imagine or video to my status it kicks me out or lags. Do better.
4,Im happy with whatsapp But i think few things like Songs should be coming while adding status just like instagram stories I don't want it to make up wholy like. Insta like adding mentions etc not necessary both are different apps but songs should come.
4,I have used 3rd party whatsapps over the years but end of the day I found simple whatsapp the Best!! I request you to add the status save option to get 5 stars and there will be no comparison to this whatsapp because it has all the functions except status save option.
5,"This app is Simple, easy to use and impressive. Found one bug in Android version 2.23.16.76 Follow these steps to replicate 1- Open status Tab in whatsapp. 2 - Find/Choose out any one active status, whether a photo or video or anything.Just concentrate on any one contact name who has posted status 3 - Now go to your Device Contacts application 4 . Update name of that contact which you choose in Step 2 5. Now go back to whatsapp and the status of that contact (you update in step 4) disaapears."
1,Now a days WhatsApp is not working perfectly. I have changed my phone & while login in it is showing use official WhatsApp. While I'm using official WhatsApp only downloaded from Google play store.
4,While we sharing screen with any one during call we don't have access the friend or colleague phone. So add feature of accessing the other screen (friend or family)by asking the permission to access their phone.
3,"telegram, I have found has pin number to access as a great security feature to be able to access the app, which is far better security than Watts app ..Also Watsapp desperately Needs PINCH ZOOM to scale to txt sizes. Not everyone has 20/20 vision. Its a classic mistake as these apps are made by the younger generation who mostly have excellent vision for now lol"
1,"I tried to open it but its showing error message ""You need to use official WhatsApp to open your account"" Even after i download from play store. I mailed many times to support team and team is replying same we only support official WhatsApp. I attached screenshots in the mail. I opened my account in another phone, reset my phone and do whatever possible as support team said. But same error.."
5,"Love the new whatsapp from Meta. It's amazing because we have the best options that we want, but WhatsApp hangs sometimes and works slowly, i mean, hangs so much. In my s21 ultra."
3,Experience is good and working perfectly. Add a download button in the statues where I can download the status and the option to separate chats and group chats
3,Themes and all are good...But a issue in my app..that was when I try to voice recording then app also hanged...so I no to send voice to others...üò¢
1,"Since updated into new material 3 ui the system ui is buggy, you dont believe me? Try yourself with different phones, all brands phone, with navigation bar or gestures, using floating windows also, check yourself dev, fix this ASAP. I suggest you do not focus on the ui, fix the stability first"
3,"Recently,when I grow people's statuses, especially pictures,it is always blurry. Why's that? Again, I do not know why I cannot send videos to my contacts. It use take me a whole lot of time, which is so unusual"
4,"It's a good app but since I updated it I'm not able to see if my messages are read please help to fix it ,I have my messages to be seen not blocked n it still won't let me see when someone reads them,the two check marks use to turn blue when someone read or opened your message now it doesn't ,that is the only reason I don't give it a 5 star ‚≠ê review"
5,"I love WhatsApp. It's my preferred messaging app, and I love all its features and how they are constantly improving. And I especially love that I can keep in touch with family and friends who are overseas for free."
1,"So, I've been recently facing a problem which is that I'm not getting WhatsApp messages unless i open it(also all the permissions and background data is on), like I'm not getting notified when I'm not using it or using some other application, or even when the phone is locked, wrong to the WhatsApp support team and no response yet, worst services"
2,"I downloaded this app on play store, yet my account is repeatedly banned even when I critically adhere to every terms and conditions. It's not really fair for me because I have a lot to do on this app educationally.........."
1,Unable to forward messages. Whenever I chose to forward a message the phone book or contact book is never displayed and so cannot forward messages please help
1,I logged in it said account blocked. It unblocked my account but the it didn't send sms. After 2 days I received the message. It logged in and after 6 hrs it blocked me again. It is frustrating to log in and be blocked then sending review and logging in and again being blocked without violating terms of service. It unblocks the account but says not real whatsapp. But I downloaded it using play store. What can I even do
1,Violates app store policies by refusing to work unless I give Facebook the ability to read all my contacts. I cannot even send a message to myself.
1,Hate the upgrade. What's the use of channels? Half my msg doesn't show while typing. Emojis that scroll throug to next one an options now at top is irritating
1,The new update is horrendous. Switching the emoji/sticker menu to the bottom bar and changing the way you interact with them is absolutely asinine and impractical.
1,"Very bad experience with new update... Why you're disturbing my privacy? When your policy is end to end encryption,,, then why you are recording my audios and videos? It's shameful for you, it's totally against policy,,,,, who you are to do this shameful and cheap act?"
1,"Worst customer service, I have been mailing you for support as my account logs out automatically and says not allowed to use or use official version of WhatsApp but no help is provided till now. I have been contacting you since 23rd June via email but no one contacted me back via call just computer generated format messages are being hand out which is frustrating."
4,"Good day WhatsApp, this app is really useful for texting and calling. I'm grateful for the existence of it. The only thing that annoys me is that others cannot see my profile picture, even though I have one (a rose). Is there any way you could fix this issue? If yes, thank you."
5,The new big box is distractive pls I mean the contact tab or what is it's function I mean that one that shows on the chats page yes that one why does it have to be that big... Well I have some solutions * You can make the button smaller and reduce it's opacity or just return it to how it was before * And always make it disappears when scrolling through Yeah that's all... hope I have been making sense to someone and hope my solutions will be useful But moreover WhatsApp is a really great app..
1,"l I was reading a long message, but suddenly the UI went down so I had to look for it and read it again. poor UI"
5,I love WhatsApp. The App is nice and good but my problem is that why Chelsea FC is not added or among the channels. Please find a way to add Chelsea FC so that I can be getting update. Thank you
1,"Poor customer service communication. The whatsapp automatically gets logged out. I don't know what happens to my whatsapp account. I can't log in again, and I am not receiving verification PIN I have to wait for 7 DAY'S to log in Even though it's not my fault üòëüòëüòë and customer care is not replying to msg üòí.."
5,"I like this app but the only problem is that ,I can't set password or pin or pattern to enter they only said end to end key ,and it requires it once in a while,pls do more about it ,I want to be putting password before entering ,apart from that , everything is okay"
1,What's app is not working in my phone It's asking for OTP and I am not getting otp.its keep on repeating same steps but no OTP or call from app team for logging. Please help me on this
1,I just dont want any channels on my status bar but there arint any options to disable it. Its just irritating me when the channels appear on the status bar. Please help me üò≠üò≠üò≠.üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ i wanted to disable channels.please helpp
1,"The latest version is a downgrade honestly speaking, I mean I can't even search for specific status to view anymore, now we have to keep scrolling until we find the user's status OMG"
5,It would be nice if we able to translate live text. So users don't have to bother copying and pasting to Google Translate when having a conversation in a foreign language.
2,"The new emoji panel is uncomfortable for use since it doesn't synchronize well with my keyboard size, so it does a really weird transition when switching. A totally useless function that shouldn't have been added"
1,When playing a voice record or a sound file screen will auto turn to black EVEN i use voice activation to on back the screen does not on back. No such issue on other app or even Telegram except for WhatsApp. Can please fix this stupid problem?
1,"Was trying the new chat transfer, galaxy z flip 3 cant even detect the qr code. Then lost all my data. Rubbish app. Cant even settle the issue for user to transfer chat easily over so many years"
1,My whatsapp is showing that this account has been banned for some reason I don't know why but I want to recover this problem as soon as possible I'm getting sick of trying these and that method whatsapp website showed that I'm supposed to write a review and they'll respond as soon as possible this is the only problem I've been facing since last night
5,If whatsapp didn't exist I'd have so many problems to talk to my friends and family. WhatsApp is a free messenger app with all features you can possibly think of.
1,"The new ""Updates"" tab is the worst thing in WhatsApp... There isn't a way to turn it off... Now WhatsApp is officially trying be one of those data hungry social media app that wants active users all the time..."
5,I love this application. It will be great if we can customize group tab beside status. That will display seperately chat and group.
1,Horrible What did you guys do to the sticker and emoji section? It was perfectly fine the way it was with having my favorites and my recent tab. Now whenever I open my sticker album I get promped with the ones I don't ever use and then I have to wait for all my stickers to load once I hit my favorites tab. Seriously fix the sticker section
1,"From the last 2 to 3 days, my WhatsApp has been hung so much that I can't even message properly. I uninstall the app and try again to open the app, but still, the issue remains. I also reset my phone, but I have no luck."
2,"WhatsApp is a very good app, my major problem with the app is the way it reduces the graphics when I have to post my pictures or anything in jpg format, sometimes it reduces to the point where I can't even see the context of what really matters."
5,Can you add a feature if user press the backspace button in Android for more than 3 second it should clear complete message. Sometime I have a very long message and I want to clear it take a lot of time. No user press the back button more than 3 second to just delete a little text its mostly the whole text
4,Sometimes you make mistake when you key in the posting. There are no way to edit it like correcting spelling mistakes etc. This is an update to my suggestion. Thank you for introducing yhe ability to edit.
1,Status search option is not available in new update...Common people wants to see status of their friends and family not channles..So plz enable status search option...Very Disgusting experience this is for me
4,Good features such as screen sharing added but few glitches noticed in the privacy settings mostly last seen and online status. You still end up seeing the last seen of people excluded from seeing your last seen and maybe not getting to see the last seen of those you choose to see theirs.
1,"I have been working with whatsapp for last ten years, but a week before on Tuesday noon my whatsapp account was logged out for no reason and it started to ask for the two step verification code which I did not set. It said that my account number is registered on another phone but there are no other devices in my house that has my number registered in it. When I asked it to send and email it did not send me anything even though I have my email address registered. It happened again today."
3,I can't add my payment method after I cleared my chat. My deleted contatct is still showing on my whatsapp contatct even though I refreshed and deleted the data. Please fix this bug.
2,Works well. But it's extremely annoying having to link my same devices over and over again in the web version. Wish they did something to fix it...
5,"Nice, This app is very good for sharing memories on statuses. Sharing media, links to friends all over the world. I like this security options but i didn't see face recognition lock in WhatsApp. I want you to add face recognition lock because we have android phones"
5,"I love how you guys take your time to update the app all the time to make it better for your users ü´∂......plus it's very simple to use the video call quality is top notch Plus as compared to some years back the App is really amazing, all the features and many more and that's why am giving it a 5 Soo I recommend everyone to use WhatsApp cause I think it's the best app for communication no matter where you are and which network you're using"
1,The app is good but I keep on facing the same problem (This account is not allowed to use WhatsApp) As I reported the problem to my all 3numbers I tried to register another number but the same thing apper. And the problem starts when WhatsApp needed to be updated. For sure the problem is costing me a lot especially for my Working places
1,The first app was good since updates it's not looking good . The channel page is not useful. The status are got in viewed update. So boring now
4,"The recent WhatsApp edit is useless , i want my stickers where they were on bottom left!!! It's so annoying not to have them there and when I touch the sticker icon it should open the recent ones and not the ones that i dont use!!!"
1,"I have been trying to login to my WhatsApp account using the official WhatsApp that I downloaded from the Google Play Store but still can't be able to login. Each time I tried to login, I get the following warning message - ""YOU NEED THE OFFICIAL WHATSAPP TO MAKE USE OF THIS ACCOUNT."" Please kindly verify my account and help me to clear this warning page that keeps stopping me from login to my account. I will be very grateful if I can be able to use m"
3,It's now frustratingly hard to just put simple text over a picture and place them in a space you need. No idea why the update changed a perfectly functional part of the app.
1,"The new updates do nothing but make the app worst. why would I want all my sticker packs to be one endless scroll. that's so stupid. If i could give this a negative amount of stars, I would"
4,"WhatsApp owner please support to edit favourite stickers.. i mean give option that user can easily adjust/replace favourite stickers like up, down, right and left for create favourite stickers group type sort. I hope you will add this option in next version."
1,My WhatsApp number is active. but WhatsApp verification OTP and call both are not coming on my WhatsApp number. My important groups are there üò≠üò≠. This is an worst system. Not have any customer care only have bot.
4,"This recent update that has the chat and update tab down, does not have the search button in the updates tab. Please fix this. Thank you very much"
1,Contacts' status update causes my devices to freeze. I think it will be better if all contacts' status can be muted with one tap (give an option in setting for it).
2,"this updated version has so many glitches. my WhatsApp isn't working now, no messages or calls are going through, no status updates but I can view statuses that were already posted. this is annoying."
4,I don't like the channels update. Remove it or hide it somewhere. P.s focus on placing the archived chats at the bottom instead.
4,"Hey WhatsApp team, I got a notification saying my whatsapp is logged in another device which I haven't I tried logging in and I am unable to access it now. I tried to uninstall and reinstall but still failed to access it. I would like to recover it please. Thank you."
2,"the app is all good , but please improve the quality of my video in status ( the quality looks like shi* when i put my video in it but whyy isn't there a hd option for it ) i please hope that u clear my request"
1,I didn't like the new channel functionality. Please give an option to turn off the recommended channel section.
4,Everything was perfect and fine it a very nice app to use but there is one problem while downloading the videos it cannot play and in status where I go and if its a video status it show error and cannot play. Please I request you to fix this bug
2,"This app wont let me download any pictures, have tried all my settings and they are all correct. Get msg but not the pictures attached...ü§î"
5,"I love the app no doubt. But I have a suggestion, won't you consider upgrading the app to grant us the experience of having the feature the same as Instagram. To be able to tag, mention and repost on our whatsapp status. It would be an exceptional profit for your company due to upgrading in such mentioned above."
5,"Your feedback helps us improve the quality and accuracy of AI answers. Keep in mind that this is an early technology preview, so it may display inaccurate or"
5,This application really helps me to communicate with many people. very easy to use and I really like the various features of WhatsApp. The part that I really like is that I can make avatars according to my own creations to be used as stickers. I really like WhatsApp üòä
4,"Bug. After updating the whtsapp is not working properly. I cant take pictures from a chat, i cant search a name. Please fix this"
5,"Hey team, The overall experience is great, just the whatsaap is taking time to refresh nd receive calls nd messages.. It's been days that it will not not show any call and then will send a message of missed call, please try to rectify this issue.. I asked some more people they are also facing same issue."
3,"After posting a video on status, the quality gets degraded so much that text becomes blurry. It was not happening earlier. Please fix this issue."
4,"Great app! I wish, however, that the functionality where one can schedule messages for sending at a later time will be added to our beloved WhatsApp. Please allow us to continue to read messages from the point we last scrolled to. Telegram has provided this for years now, why is it taking so long to catch up?"
1,"Emoji Keyboard is bugged since last update, can't see the chat anymore while it's open. Always need to open then close and open again to make it work. All in all this app is getting worse and worse with every update"
3,"Overall its an amazing app! But, I think there should be a feature that if somehow the app is deleted, after logging again the data should be saved. It'd not be deleted!"
1,Whenever open what's app but app suddenly close and can't sent video message in what's app chat in my Samsung galaxy S20+ And Beta also uninstall. Please fix the problems. Thanks
1,"Whatsapp keeps blocking my account . After the review, they apologize and block it again after 1 videocall to my family or messages sent on the company group . This process takes 2 days to undo as they lag in sending me a verification code . The new excuse is that I have a ""3rd party app"" which is downloaded from playstore as a redirect from their website . 1 mistake is acceptable, but 8 times on 2 devices in 10 days is ridiculous ."
5,"Using whatsapp has been a great experience! It's safe, easy to use and not complicated at all. I hate the recurring freezing of the app though but it's all well and good!"
4,"I love whatsapp, but i think one more feature need to be added. Which is schedule status, it's is help to us to wish any kind of wishes on time. Like birthday wishes, anniversary wishes etc. Are you agree with me? Edit: One more thing added privacy pin lock for security for those device's which doesn't has fingerprint scanner."
5,Hey Whatsapp! We need an update which allows us to hide profile picture from specific people. My darzi (and some of my colleagues) have no business seeing my selfies. Please update this feature... Thank you!
2,The new update is not good... as it contains a find a channel section...which covers a half of screen and gives a bad look... üëé
1,I've been trying to log in my whatsapp but it's not work it's showing that am not using the official whatsapp I've deleted and download its more than twice now but it's not working PLS what's wrong I need to access my whatsapp pls Waiting for response...
1,Why did you add channels in WhatsApp Anybody asked you to add channels? Remove it because it's irritating. If you don't Remove the channels then me and colleague's will uninstall the WhatsApp Messengerüò°üò°üò°
4,"It's all good... Kindly do some updates about finding groups like in search bar we can search audio, documents and many more things; do some updates about finding groups and please use bottom navigation of chats, calls etc."
1,The new beta with channels integrated beneath the status updates looks horrible and foreceful. Why not WhatsApp stay as a messaging platform and not some everything app.
1,"Last versions have made the old good WhatsApp to a heap of bugs and obstacles, overfed with useless and much storage needing and hindering studied childish things, instead having programmed it with integrated really helpful features. In every respect it has become even more confusing, cumbersome, difficult to set up, more obnoxious. a truly 'ill' conditioned, unpleasant, absolutely sickeningthing.The next evil thing is the proprietary behaviour of meta and the employees who work for WhatsApp."
5,This app is the best app for families to be connected together.but sometimes some unknown number are came that we even block them is not really good they call us offline they send message to us but offensive inappropriate messages so there should be a safety bottun like the report one is good ..i will say there should be more protective options like that ..But on the other side this app is really appreciated by me...
3,"This app been great so far all round. However, recently many androids or apple users have difficulty to receive incoming, it seems whatsapp somehow often, put to do not disturb function, even when the settings of background user data is set to be on. Some of my friends have the same issue. We can only receive calls or text, after we open whatsapp. Kindly help to adjust it for urgent matters of the users."
1,"After the update, the UI is poor. The keypad won't automatically open when I try to reply to a specific message after selecting it. Please fix this bug"
1,Unwanted features in new update WhatsApp channel no one can use these unwanted channels For this type of update peoples have already other apps...... This update makes the whtasapp useless...... request WhatsApp to remove this feature from the app......
5,Everything good and well but how do I change my WhatsApp keyboard to how it was before the update?! This keyboard is really messing and also feels slow to navigate. PLEASE give us an option to choose b/w new and old WA keyboard.
3,"The new channel update is unnecessary. Can we just have a messaging app, there's no need to be following people on every platform"
4,"Contact made super easy with this app. Everything is good in this but in Light mode the calling interface and status interface is in dark mode only, if this changed it looks great."
3,unable to understand how the message can be edited after sending? Secondly in audio call the voice quality is too low. Hope to have a change. Thanks.
4,"Not a fan of the new emoji tray animation, it's a little too slow compared to the old one. Also not a fan that the delete button for emojis has moved to the top right."
1,I dont care of your user interface but please make the privacy stable. What is wrong with your privacy after 2 or 3 calls account is getting ban. Please check your privacy policy and take action according to that. Dont try to make too fancy.. Whatsapp was far better year ago
1,After the last update the app became so crashy and the keyboard gets stuck alot of times other than that the new emoji and gif window is so bad especially for those who use gustiors for system navigation (like me)and most of the time it doesn't even work
3,"I am having issues in registering my WhatsApp account on this device. I am not receiving any calls or SMS when I attempt to register. Secondly, I am being told ""you need the official WhatsApp to use this account"" I updated my WhatsApp when this began to happen. If you can, please, resolve this issue."
2,"Bad! Remove the image compression. Often I send pictures or long screenshots containing text and my friends cannot see the text because of quality compression in Whatsapp. When I reached you via email, You replied, 'To avoid low quality profile pictures, we suggest using an image with height and width of at least 192 pixels.' A user don't have to check all those criteria before sending image. Remove the image compression and there will be no problem."
1,I updated my watsup..but look dis updation looks terriable..what kind of u made the new features are very confusing part..don't add all other industries include in it... please stay like first as it is..
1,I read all terms and conditions but my WhatsApp is not open and not working and verification code also not received. Then how my WhatsApp is open in mobile. Not even single response receive from your side. I want help but your team denied . It's very very shameful. Your WhatsApp team doesn't care the customer.üò°üò†üò°üò°
1,"I can't seem to open my WhatsApp, it shows that I've been using some fake version of WhatsApp and it won't proceed to even deregistering my account! Need help ASAP!"
5,"I have been using whatsapp for years, never incounter any problem until this year when i lost my device, and log in through different devices before i shift to a new trusted device, and it has been a month i cant log in to my whatsapp account, just given this not ""you need to use an official authorized app"" yet i have installed official whatsapp, i have tried whatsapp business but same error, i cant use my ac i have tried to contact developer but no answer, please help me am losing my customers"
1,i'm having to send the same gif 2-3 times as it keeps saying 'retry'..its starting to get really annoying as it has been months and this happens 80 percent of the times im sending a gif
5,Screen Sharing is an Awesome feature. I just love it. It will be great if we can give screen control to the caller as well. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1,"Only use this app for work friends, and when online stores use WhatsApp for their contact. I've never spammed anything and my account randomly gets blocked for spam. Their algorithm needs to be updated, if they just looked at my logs/activity they'd know they made a mistake, but it's still banned. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Would not recommend."
1,"I always got a bug when I am trying to send several Pictures and crop every single one of them. After I had finished crop all of them and see to check it, it will come to the original Picture. Please help me"
1,"This latest update completely messed up the emoji panel. It changed everything. Seriously, WhatsApp Team... why change something that already works perfectly and that everyone's used to it? If it ain't broken, don't fix it!"
1,"The quality of the pictures and videos that are uploaded become blurry...Whereas when viewed from the gallery, it is bright and becomes blurry after uploading. Please improve the quality when we upload a picture in the status!!!!"
2,"Where do I begin? For starters you can't transfer chats from iOS to android using WhatsApp provided tools. It is absolutely bonkers that a company like meta can't make it work. So many bugs like flickering images, having to do extra steps to mark a chat as read (unlike iOS version where you swipe) Unfortunately we are stuck with their monopoly."
1,I dont like the channels update. I dont want to have all those intrusive stuff on my phone and I dont know how to delete them. Horrible and so annoying
2,New update is worst. New positions are completely different from old. Cannot choose any sticker faster and its really bad for user experience. Fix that.
4,"I suggest they should add editing features for status just incase one makes mistake in his or her write up, just like in chat."
1,"New update for the stickers tab is horrible. Don't really get why there is a need to wait for it to scroll through hundreds of stickers just to get to a certain sticker pack. It was working perfectly fine the last update, why ruin it in this one?"
5,An app that may be essential in the future. I really like this texting with the idea that I'm not being read by some tech wizard.
5,I enjoy this app and I use a lot every day. There is something you can include for accessibility is show the audio's text transcripted because sometimes we can't heard the voice note or for deaf people too!
4,"Nice app, but can you make new feature that separates chat group and personal chat please... :) It's hard while finding information from group chat because sometimes too many personal chat i receive so the group chat is far down"
4,"A feature that sending images in HD is out in WhatsApp few weeks back, initially I got option for 2 days after that I am unable to see that option again. Kindly solve this issue"
1,"I registered my first number on WhatsApp and it got blocked for no reason, just some claims that I had breached some terms of service. I hadn't done anything wrong. I tried registering a new number yesterday and now it says I should download the official version of WhatsApp. I've uninstalled and redownloaded the app several times but nothing seems to be working. I missed an exam because of this. I don't know what to do right now."
5,I love the app me and my bestie are always talking 24/7 but my one wish is to make the app to be able to make the status video thing longer and not 30 seconds so that I can post my bestie s amazing dance moves
5,The new update done with the emoji icon is not upto the mark. When we tap the emoji icon the emoji list range is pop up & the display list is very short and also we need to scroll to use other emojis. The emoji icon was good before the update there is no need to make any changes in emoji icon for now. Overall update is good.
3,"This app is good enough to be graded with three stars as its efficiency and convenient. Unlike 2 years ago, this app is no longer functioning even after the update. Its really unfortunate, to say the least. I now grade it *ZERO STAR*"
3,My internet speed has been very good when i used other apps. But when i send any video clip or voice msgs or photos (even of 2 or 3 MBs) from my whatsapp... sending of video is very slow..too much taking time. Please fix it.
3,"The small update where the emoji, gif and sticker has changed to a new feature design annoys me because I was so used to the ""original"" Now when I use the emojis I accidentally select the wrong ones and the deleting button is so weirdly placed, would be better if it's back to its OG"
5,I really like this app.. but one minus is there.. please merge all call history from call history it's showing time wise call history. Make it call history in in one single calls
4,Have just started using WhatsApp. Still finding out different functions. I'm old so it will take me longer to learn the full range.
1,"Lots ofThere are many different different problems with WhatsApp nowadays. problems nowadays on WhatsApp. Sometimes it will be fine. Sometimes there is a problem. Today when I am opening my WhatsApp it automatically closes. Whenever I am opening, they are getting closed automatically."
3,"App is good but it doesn't allow audio messages to auto play when the screen is off or black, and it doesn't play in background. So developers fix that only."
1,The UI keeps getting worse. The new emoji keyboard is appalling. The payment button is downright misplaced and annoying. It's such a shame given the actually good features like message editing and video note
1,"WhatsApp's recent updates have been a source of frustration for many users, including myself. The changes to emoji and GIF control options have made it challenging to express ourselves effectively, causing irritation. Furthermore, it has become difficult to communicate smoothly with my girlfriend, Sara, due to glitches and delays in message delivery. These issues hinder the quality of our conversations. We hope WhatsApp can prioritize user convenience and address these technical challenges promp"
2,"The latest version of whatsapp is the most annoying version of this app I've ever used... I give it 2 stars because, voicemail and calls are quite alright but there really are issues at the level of status updates... I can no longer give an image a color filter but instead, when I click on the filter I want, it takes me to status privacy... This is really annoying please... And too, if it were possible, an option for uploading audio from phone as status too would make things ideal I think..."
1,I don' t know what's wrong with this app.........i can't even send videos anymore......this problem really needs to be fixed......because it's making me loose intrest in this joke of an app
2,Since the last update I've been unable to access emojis I have to drag the keyboard so that I can access them which sometimes it refuses to pop up..Kindly assist
4,"I'm using the WhatsApp for 8 years I have very good experience and the new update is also awesome but I need something more in WhatsApp that is the ""mute calls""option.Add this option"
2,"Facing issue while listening to voice messages. The screen blinks, and voice message stops. There's no continuity that the voice message will play at one go. Please fix this problem. Using OnePlus 7 handset currently and Android version is up-to-date, also the installed the latest version for WhatsApp too. Let me know if we've fix to this. Thanks, Divya"
1,"Couldn't be register my number for this app as it is not permitted stating that ""you need official WhatsApp to use this account"", though it is official one. Can it be solved. Plz allow me to use. Previously, I have used this app for several years with due diligence. But don't the reason for which my account was blocked and later restored. Now, I am unable to use the App for the aforesaid reasons."
5,WhatsApp is one of the best application for privacy. All your chat with your love one are end to end encrypted which cannot be seen by any other person. Also the view once feature is best . Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
2,Still no update where you can edit your caption on your status AFTER posting it just in case u made a mistake instead of deleting your status and posting it all over again??
3,Finding the right emoji becomes difficult when writing a message. So if an emoji could be pinned then we could pin our favorite and useful emojis and send messages very quickly. I think it is very important.
1,"This app, is not suitable for old people because it has to be updated approximately every two weeks. Too much changes then . Old people (80years old) do not have the time(!) or inclination to adjust to this extent. I am supposed to have the ability. I think the updating of phones take so much data ( money! Money!...) and we, oldies have so little time and money left, that we should receive special consideration and be dealt with differently. I am considering putting the phone away..."
1,"I was on a Whatsapp video call yesterday, my phone's front flashlight was on while I was on the video call and then suddenly the light glitched and went off and it totally affected my phone both the phone's flashlight, camera flash light, none of the flashlights work anymore Please rectify it, because I know that this is a problem Whatsapp caused and my battery was 90% when this happened so definitely it's not a low battery that caused it"
1,"Full of bugs since recently. Keyboard no longer automatically opens if you reply to a message, and if your keyboard is opened and you press the stickers tab half of your screen is taken up by a blank bar."
5,Been a lover and user of this app since 2011 from the java app days inlove with the consistency in development but there's a new feature I find in Instagram which I think we would also love here how about we get messages from contacts that are not saved as a request? so as to help privacy and curb the edges of receiving unwanted messages from strangers cause really one can't keep blocking a bunch of people you know at least we should get to choose who can contact us using WhatsApp.
1,We are living in age of 4g and 5g there is no need for pre process the media files we are sending it compress the file size but also takes the image/video quality to cheap level use high efficiency compression which only reduces size not quality this app is total waste in that thing this app is not suitable for creators who wants to use status for promotion. Learn something from video panda compression tool available on play store
5,"I'm using this app since last so many years... mistakenly an app is downloaded by vidmate.. and that whatsapp was not protected by google.. since then my account was hacked by the third party.. and my number was no more registered on whatsapp... I have tried so many times.. but of no use... whrnever I try to create my account.. I receive the message that ""your phone number is banned from using this "" kindly help..."
1,"Problem identify, I am using Whatsapp since long. Recently Whatsapp not working and unable to proceed verification on my existing number +88016******** also failed on Business version but few minutes earlier I have registered different operator+88013******** with successful verification on same phone. Request to solve the issue at earliest convenience."
2,"There is some issue with the notification. Even data is on, but any kind of notification from the WhatsApp is not received."
2,"What's with the update removing the search button for the ""status"" category? Put it back, sometimes, I want to research someone's status and had to scroll andanually search them."
3,"Why does uncle Mark keep spoiling this app. Forget about adding updates that no one needs and just go ahead and fix the problems at hand. Like, why can't I send a video to my status without it being blurry and all? Why can't I play a voice note without my phone going off? Please fix the problems, thank you."
1,"Very unreliable. Massive issues changing phones, have lost all my conversations history once before, changing phones and numbers is a nightmare. Most recently changing phones and numbers crashed my brand new phone. Now it will not even open. Have lost all my conversation history multiple times. Have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and now it just crashes everytime I try to open the app. Won't let me even try to use it. No response from support either."
3,Please give an option to hide the Channels section if we don't want to use it. It just looks ugly and distracting. Thanks.
1,Changed my mind this is one of the worst apps I have ever used. It keeps saying I am not using the original version of WhatsApp messenger while I'm using the original version. I can't login cause of this. I have tried connecting them and they replied but they did not help at all.
5,It's very easy to using process and massage & calls available to the app so this app very nice and good reference . security massage and videos atc. So it's very nice appp .
1,100% of the group voice chats I've started or have been invited to since you started testing the feature were done by mistake. Change the icon to one that makes any sense and add a confirmation modal explaining the action before starting a call with dozens of people.
5,Great app...Do we have Any settings to Hide Channels Part .. Because we are not interested to follow channel of others....We have alternative for that...It will be good if any option to hide.Thanks
2,"I have been enjoying my WhatsApp till I notice a change in the status page layout and the channel thing, WhatsApp is suppose to be a private space why should I add a disturbing channel to it?"
3,"The bug with video playback after viewing a status hasn't been resolved, that's the special update many are waiting for! Thanks."
1,"What's app is getting worst day by day in the name of new version udpates... Recently I had my Android updated to a new version and realised what's app pop up notifications which made me access my what's app better and had me at ease is not unavailable, I have also started receiving messages business which I have never signed up to this is now annoying me I am unaware of any messages I receive on what app until I myself wish to engage into the application...I guess I would uninstall if continued"
2,Everything is good... But whenever I'm forwarding or sending someone something... It is taking a lot really a lot of time to show the contacts
5,"What is this? There are two ways of quoting a message in WhatsApp. Open your WhatsApp and find the message you want to quote. The first way to quote in WhatsApp is by swiping right on the particular message, and WhatsApp will immediately quote the message, and you can add your quote and send the message. Thank you so much"
1,I am unable to use my WhatsApp account. I think it was some sort of glitch so many people were joining a what's app group at once and it was mistaken for me of spamming.. so please look into it.. i am a student and i really really need this account very bad experience I was doing no such wrong if anyone at what's app reads this pls help me I am in desprete need of that account back....
1,I hate your new update. Your update is playing with my comfort zone. I want the old version of what's app which is good and easy to use. The new update has all the labels at the bottom which is so irritating and makes it so difficult to use. Can't even engage with messages properly. Or else keep it optional to update atleast.
4,This is very good App . But some time issues are acourd next update every thing slov . This is very best app for earning and very good management who deals this App. I like it very much
4,What is happening with the emojis. Sometimes when you use one and press send it you can not see your message until you press the arrow to leave the conversation. It is confusing
1,The new channels feature removes muted statuses. Thats disorganising my whatsapp statuses. Whatsapp should ask us users for concernt if we allow the new feature or not. Not everybody wants channels
3,"Media Upload Quality option not showing in my wahstap settings in data and storage, can please guide why it is not showing even am using latest version, when I upload status it's totally losses qaulity even of the video is short smaller in size, please need help"
1,"I got a new phone and have been trying to get What's App to work. It only sees 1 group chat that I don't even use anymore. I can't restore backup chat to new phone. I can't transfer chat either. And to use it on old phone I have to reset it back up, which removes it from this phone."
1,"The app is great, problem is that group chats and individual inbox messages are all mixed up. I sometimes fail to see someone's message and end up being blamed. Instead of the community tab, why can't you separate individual chats and group chats."
1,Why did they add a channel section under status? They should add a hide/disable button for this feature because why would I want to view social media on an app that I use to text friends and family
3,Pls enable message scheduling! There's another app that has this useful feature. Most of the time i remember that i have something to say but i can't do it on that moment bc of the time and i forget what i wanted to communicate. Pls include it.
3,WhatsApp is a really great app. The app really helps you to communicate with people everywhere and anywhere at anytime. I don't know if it is just me but sometimes the calls cuts out for no reason and today when I tried calling someone I couldn't hear the other person and it kept saying the call was reconnecting. Is there any possible way to fix this issue if it is one please.
4,"I have this downloaded in a laptop and pc and it's laggy. I type something and it can't keep up. The letters apprear way later than they're supposed to. Same for moving through different chats. At times, I end up sending a message to the wrong chat simply because it doesn't change the pages as quickly as it's supposed to."
4,I had just got an additional feature-channels and it was ballistic but it seems it has been disabled immediately or otherwise. When will the feature go live?
1,"Please fix your f-tup decision to change the emoji/sticker layout! It is the most annoying update you possibly could've done! I will change over to Viber or Telegram because of this update! Every time you use an emoji, go back and type and then use an emoji again every thing jump around! Really NOT impressed! If I could rate it a 0 I would!"
2,"You guys just keep bringing updates and make them mandatory to install, but in some devices these latest versions are not compatible. So what about us. Please look into this and make some compatible version for old devices like WhatsApp lite or something!"
1,EDIT: Lost the ability to edit messages Please keep the option to show notifications when muting a chat as I would still like to see the messages without being notified
1,"I use WhatsApp for my business purpose and have upto 1000+ groups, and daily usage is about 1Lack messages a day. I use a gaming phone, still my WhatsApp take a lot of time to load while forwarding a message. This load time cause alot of issues, as I have to share media of my products using these groups, due to which my customers faces a lot of delay."
2,"I used to throughly enjoy being able to use this as an alternative to texting, however, the unfortunate thing is that Popup notifications are no longer available to my phone. Will this issue be fixed in the future? Thank you"
5,Umm.. It's a good app for conversation u can easily delete messages and u can easily delete your status and everything is good about it.
3,Playing voice notes is a horrible experience. I love WhatsApp but it's frustrating when the volume of the note suddenly drops too low or just pauses for no reason.
1,There should be option to allow selective individuals to see the blue ticks (read receipts) once the message is read instead of allowing all people to see the blue ticks
2,"Its a good communication app. But some settings should change. Specially this backing up method. While in an important conversation backup prompts, and 1st it is preparing then backing up then uploading. Until end first two nothing can do in the conversation. My opinion Backup process should not disturb to users. It can be done by a counter in notification panel rather than on top notification in middle of screen. Scheduling doesn't work properly and backup via cellular data also not work."
4,"This is a great app but I suggest that you guys include all the features these Unofficial WhatsApps (GB WhatsApp) has like separating groups from personal chats, and other attractive features in the GB WhatsApp. Thanks"
1,"The new update for channels to be followed sucks. It makes whatsapp to be boring, especially by being on the status category. It sucks."
5,"I would not recommend WhatsApp to be used for businesses. However it is very helpful for individual usage. It delivers quick, timely, functional, and consistent communication between any two individuals over half decent Wi-Fi. It has its kinks to it, like kicking you off once you start running low on storage, or automatically downloading the photos of friends when you forgot to unselect that option. But over all it is a great program to use!"
5,"Great app, now better with edit mode, but messages can only be edited within 15 min. Should not limit editing frequency"
1,"Unable to see any photo being shared to me. Not even the status and stories. It says- 'unable tk download, please try again later'"
4,"Overall good. Please include the option of editing the caption of the status after uploading it. Also add thr option of including the button with which, a user can reach the top of the chat"
2,The app is quite good but you really need to improve it to match the features and designs of third part applications where the app can save status independently and with WhatsApp groups separated from other individual chats.
5,"i have nothing to describe, this app is just very helpful for sharing information to others, also to improve the relation range or friendship as well i got no problem with it alhamdullillah, hope it can be better each time. i've never rated apps before, so yeah :v that's all i could tell based on my experience, thanks."
1,"This last update is whack.who wants channels on their whatsapp? My muted contacts in status section disappeared,I can't find the search button for statuses"
1,"What's happened to emoji UI? Updated 23/8 and now the emoji UI is so cumbersome and unintuitive. Can't quickly go back to keyboard from emoji board like I was used to. Bring the old UI back or improve on this new one, so that it's easier to switch between emojis and keyboard"
4,"What's App is now a day is very important tool for formal & imformal communication . It has been adapted as a office communication tool. It is very easy & fast. Also very useful for like minded group , social work. ‡§ñ‡§∞‡•á‡§§‡§∞ Whats App ‡§®‡•á ‡§è‡§ï ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•Ä ‡§ò‡§°‡§ä‡§® ‡§Ü‡§£‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§π‡•á. ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§® ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ö‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§£ ‡§¨‡§£‡§≤‡•á ‡§Ü‡§π‡•á."
1,"Status video & photo quality compression is getting worse. Like, really bad. Please please please fix this. Why yall keep making the all worse?"
3,WhatsApp still can send messages faster than any other software when your wifi is super slow..like mine. The only problem is that I cant view full chat history of a group after joining late. Pls update that problem.
4,"No doubt it's an app which nowadays necessary to keep in phone for many useful purposes. It's now became a part of our day-to-day life. But a biggest problem rises here that it doesn't have the features that if the phone has been format, it's very difficult to backup the chats. If it is not done at that instant of time when the app is installed, the chat will never be there again. In this process, useful information are lost forever. This is not the same case with other apps."
3,Pop up notification is now available in Android this is very poor thing which is happening please try to make a solution for this so that people can read message by pop up notification
5,"This is certainly a very useful App. I will recommend it to all my friends and relatives, simple and easy !!! I love the clarity of the sound, awesome üëç pls try it, you will be more than satisfied I am and so will you!!!"
5,"I really like WhatsApp. It has helped me so much, in my life. I had a heavenly life, then my husband died, and then a big brother and then another brother. Life was too much to bear and I was so brokenhearted. By writing to my friends, who encouraged me, and what I was going through, really helped me mentally as I put my feeling to text, and my friends replied back in response with their words of encouragement. I am not over the hurdle but WhatsApp has really helped me so very much! Thankyou WA!"
5,"WhatsApp is relatively safe, sound and good to utilize. Still I want to suggest you to add a feature to change the theme of this app that will be only on the particular user's mobile. Please also add the feature to change the app icon only for a particular mobile user id they want. Thanks"
1,"We don't want channels in WhatsApp,it's Affecting the entire view of status updates . we don't want our private communication app filled with other content creators cringe."
1,I have been receiving late messages and my messages are also sending late I try to fix it by installing the app again but that didnot solve my problem.All apps in my mobile are working fine except whatsapp
1,"I've been using whats app since 8 + years now i've never been so dissappointed , you guys have now changed the sticker ,emoji and gif section now its has may bugs , and its too slow to use i can't navigate my sticker its to confusing my request you to bring back the old feature asap."
2,"Uch,no- latest UI update not great,WhatsApp!The way everything moves up & down the screen when trying to select & use emojis while typing now feels really fiddly.Like trying to type a popup. Please put it back how it was!ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2,"It's been good till now. Video chat has been iffy, but most likely because my phone is old. I am a regular user of this app. But now I disapprove because they've made new Transgender imojis. I dislike and highly disapprove of this update!! It shouldn't be part of this app or any app."
1,I dont feel safe with this app on my phone. I've had it where random people have added me to group chat and I never thought they could do anything like that. It just goes to show that on what's app you dont need to know the person or there number too add them to group chat. I think it's an absolute disgrace
5,WhatsApp is a really great app. The app really helps you to communicate with people everywhere and anywhere at anytime. I don't know if it is just me but sometimes the calls cuts out for no reason and today when I tried calling someone I couldn't hear the other person and it kept saying the call was reconnecting. Is there any possible way to fix this issue if it is one please.
2,"Recently I'm not able to use Whatsapp because on and off has bug , I did clear cashe , I did restart my phone , I did even update the app , unfortunately none of them helped whatsapp work properly ,at the end I deleted app and reinstalled it , the dates of my messages changed . Ridiculous."
1,If it's not broke don't fix it!! I don't understand why tech people feel that they need to update and change things every year. Yesterday I could send messages and talk to my family and friends and today my WhatsApp has disappeared and my messages are gone. Maybe you think that you're helping us but the older generation finds this to be a pain. Now at 65 I have to find out how to get my WhatsApp back on my phone.
1,My experience is horrible in verification of phone number. Even support team is useless as they just shared only template based emails even without reading whole problems.
5,Great operational menu & design. Easy to operate. I also like the new edit text feature even after sending as well as profile photo in group chats.
5,"Wonderful app so far. Chat privacy improved, you can also post audio clips on your status. I'd love there to be filters for video callsüíñ"
4,"It is a request to WhatsApp that the new update that you have brought in the video call should be removed as soon as possible to rotate it, talking left or right at night while sleeping, the image becomes small, due to which I have a problem."
5,This app now have 1 problem when I want Listen my voice message so I play then suddenly screen is off and also same problem with audio call. But video call not problem it's working properly
3,"I think WhatsApp should remove a online thing because as we go online people see we are online..I think we don't need to update our contacts as we are online...if kept last seen...it's fine...but People who don't keep last. Seen...like me...I dont want to update people like I am online...this should be removed or. This option should be hide ... I want wtapp to upgrade by adding music to the status on app, by adding pictures we can also add music on it."
1,I am unable to call anyone ever since I updated the app. I tried contacting WhatsApp Support thrice but my tickets are closed automatically before I even get the chance to speak to an actual human instead of an AI which is of absolutely no use.
2,"Since the last update and I log out from the app,i find difficult to login again please help me fix this issue I have been always referred back to play store where as my app is updated. I have been using whatsapp for long. Please help me to logging back my account."
1,"Stop moving the emoji, sticker etc. Button here and there. Users will get used to one thing and instead of developing something useful, you people are moving buttons here and there for the sake of updates."
4,I didn't give 5 stars for one reason. When I try to use the app in landscape mode it is always glitchy and barely works. But other than that I'm fully satisfied. If you could only fix that I would give it 5 stars.
4,"Kindly improve the quality of photo & video that we upload in the status, if can't improve the quality of photo and video that's ok but please don't reduce the quality. Its a humble request please focus on this area. The quality of status uploading contents are very low. Kindly improve in this area on next update."
1,"can't play video of view photo without file access permission. please fix. pop up permission is for ""to send media..."" I'm not sending, just viewing. ""media viability"" is disabled. iPhone didn't need file permission."
5,"suddenly we have faced some issues while using the WhatsApp business app, the issue is while I'm trying to send a message to someone, it doesn't send, I tried so many times it doesn't send then I tried to uninstall the app & install it again, then I entered my number & I didn't receive the OTP yet, I'm trying so many times but I didn't receive it, I have attached the screenshots, please resolve this issue asap"
5,It takes time to learn for old people who have not yet used it. We need something like a tutorial. Overally the app is fine and it runs well on any device. Keep it up guys you have set an example
1,"I can not use the photo filters, whenever I try to use it the do not work and after tapping the filter it redirected to the messege page! totally bad experience, developera should fix this"
1,After downloading new version My photos are automatically not showing in gallery and older photos are deleted from WhatsApp . how can I get this please help .??
4,"Hi Team, The new update of linking devices is very useful. We need not worry about losing chats. One suggestion is that there must be an option to make a secondary device as primary."
4,"It's good... But please include chats as 'Delete once Read' even in the notifications too,,, so that passwords or otp is deleted once it's being viewed even in the notifications. Please do include this feature in voice and video messages also."
5,"WhatsApp is the best üëå, but something is missing. Calling background should be editable, meaning someone can change the background to the desired image. Thank you üòä üíì"
2,"This new update has confused me in away. I tried to approach another watsap , which ended in my number being banned from using whaatsap I must say the old vision worked just fine for me. Now I'm having a problem that I can't fix."
1,The worst Update Ever. We are not interested in social usase of this app. We use this as personal usases with close one. So kindly remove channel features.
4,It's a great chatting app. But from last night I can't open it. I have a problem opening the app. Please fix this bug. Is this a some kind of glitch in android phone or something like that. I hope you would fix this issue as soon as possibleüòá
2,"The app is good and everything but now every time you want to use your own sticker packs, they won't even load in anymore."
1,The new update sucks. Inboxes delay to be seen by the recipient. And dps delay to update themselves on other people's profiles. Lame
1,I have been using whatsapp few years now swap to business whatsapp but recently wanna switch back to get some data but somehow i wanna switch back and cannot be done. It kept showing cannot be connect and log in to it can u help ? It kept show initialising ...
2,"In the latest update, you can't change the profile picture of a whatsapp group. The application just shuts down Tried this for the last 2 days and it keeps closing the entire App, please work on this. Thanks"
3,"Why we can't listen to WhatsApp voice messages on android auto?? When you'll be able to hear the text message via a message reader, it's makes a very common sense that we should be able to listen to the voice memo messages on android auto or apple car play. When you going to add this future?"
3,"When I am on a voice call, I am not able to shift to Bluetooth. Please fix the bug."
2,"The HD feature is no longer available,for all photos in the new update, really bad"
1,"Hello WhatsApp support, I am encountering the error message ""you need the official WhatsApp to use this account,"" despite using the official app from the authorized app store I have tried updating, restarting, and reinstalling the app without success. please assist in resolving this issue promptly. Thank you"
5,After every update WhatsApp getting more and more commercial..or public platform......which was previously private massege app.....u guys need to understand not all new gen people use your WhatsApp.....it gets more and more complicated for my mother to use it ....now you add chennal...to it there is no need for that ... atleast u can give options to turn it off
2,Hi whatsapp I'm facing difficulties while using kindly resolve this. Entire whatsapp setting changed in my mobile also I tried to attach the screen shot not can't.
1,NEW UPDATE really messed up the emoji/sticker/gif section. It condenses everything to the bottom and leaves this big gap of space for no reason. You have to constantly have to pull up the the emoji part. It's really annoying. Please fiz
1,"If someone send me photos in HD and file mode , then photos and videos not showing on my album or phonots app . Totally third class experience"
3,"I don't know what WhatsApp is playing at, but this new update is terrible. The whole app is now confusing. Why remove the search for status, the community stuff is annoying and the follow feature is not necessary, argghhhhh"
1,"The most horrible app. Can't edit messages, deleteing shows that you've deleted a message for the receiver. Deletes old messages automatically when logging in to a new revice if there's no backup."
1,"My story appears short than what ive upload. Probably 15 sec, but the original is 30 sec. And very low quality video uploaded."
1,WhatsApp has been very inconsistent later closing g account at random without any cogent reasons. Later open it and close again then open. I mean what exactly is the problem saying system malfunction but repeating it all over again. It is sickening.
5,"This version of whatsapp is actually the best yeah,it surprised me that i could be able to edit messages 15 minutes after sending it,i used to be angry whenever it's time to update my WhatsApp but awww this version of it got me this time, It's actually one of the best version tho,ouchhh to anyone who hasn't updated theirs because they're really missing a lot here"
5,A small suggestion from my side (a small software update in app) Ex- if one person wants to wish to his bestie at the 12am but sometimes he may be slept. So he forgotten it. So am requesting to update app automatically send message to concern person when the net on like alaram type.Thank you
1,"Fail on the WearOS launch. The app tells you to connect to WiFi but on Galaxy Watch 5 you don't have a choice to connect to WiFi, the app eeds to tell the watch it needs WiFi otherwise it automatically disconnects. One way to force WiFi is to turn off Bluetooth but WhatsApp also needs that."
4,"Dear WhatsApp every thing is perfect in WhatsApp .... but I wanted to have a translator to change the text to the language l know, Telugu to English , because many people of WhatsApp group's are mostly forwarding the text in there native language and many of us don't know other languages but l wanted to read the text and I don't know how to read it sooo please( I need a translator option to translate text to English ) thanku for amazing app .. bye"
1,"Bring back the previous emoji, gif and sticker keyboard style.. new one is very annoying. At previous version we can swipe left/right to switch between different emojis but now swiping it's changing between emoji-gif-sticker. I need the old style"
1,"What do you mean by chat lock? Don't you know meaning of archive and chat lock? Give a seperate option that it should visible on chats list and lock option should visible aside of chat to know weather it is locked or not. Like that. Hope you people understanded the requirement. And bring notification when someone mentioned us in groups, bring screen share without call., Note:- Bring safety scan for viral or share links or pics by someone (use Ai for fast scan)."
4,"Im encountering an error message "" You Need the Official WhatsApp to Use This Account,"" despite using the original app from the authorzied app store. Please can anyone help me ,ive tried updating, switching to WhatsApp Business and even switching device. Please solve this as soon as possible. Thank you."
1,New update very irritated. Because status bar convert in updates and its show many channels. It's very bad update
2,"If any story is of 2 or 3 minutes, its parts should be set automatically while playing the story. and thank you"
4,"Dear Developers, Please add a symbol or a dot in the corner of the profile picture if someone is online on WhatsApp. It will help very much to find if they are active in the internet. It will make the task easier of communication. Anyone can get to know if they are online and will message then. It will be helpful. It's also in Telegram. And please also increase the time limit of 'Edit' a message like the 'Delete for Everyone' option time limit. Learn from telegram"
1,"For the past week, I've been unable to log in on my whatsapp after I changed my phone The verification code is not being sent to me i don't know what is happening I've sent you my complaint on email but nothing is being done I've lost some important things due to this delay What should i do?"
1,The new UX is awful. When trying to react to messages with emojis it is now super slow and clunky to search for something. Constantly selecting wrong search bar. My phone is pixel 7 pro
1,Audio messages will NOT play. Audio is on. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Searched for fixes. None worked. I'll uninstall and use messenger instead! What a waste of time!
1,"After updating my WhatsApp, I could no longer view muted updates. That section had disappeared completely. This means I can't unmute them at all,as it was before the new update. This is not okay. Please look into this."
1,"Is there any way to delete the channels page or part of my whatsapp, I hate seeing all the channels down there and haven't found the part in settings to de activate it"
1,"I can't imagine that I will taking amazing photos and videos only to post status update and realize that Whatsapp makes blurry. Why did y'all remove the photo upload quality option? All these emoji updates are very unnecessary, now can even send quality photos or videos anymore."
1,"It's good to use individually but from last day it's creating issue in playing voice note continuously , I can't listen to voice note even can't record it , kindly help to fix it as soon as possible"
5,Using this for a long period of time and after the recent few updates its not compatible with my redmi 9c device. Cant change the filter of the status cuz it went too below and when i click an effect it goes to status privacy and there are few more bugs in the updates . Please give me a solution ‚ù§
3,The overall app is very good but the reason for the 3 stars is that the status function is not working well for me. The status view is leaving out the person who sees my status and I don't get to know which one of them saw it which is kinda annoying in the sense
1,It's so disappointing that the andriod version of whatsapp is still the old mobile app style. It's ridiculous at this point and the special features iphone versions get that andriod phones aren't entitled to. This should be fixed. It's annoying
5,"The WhatsApp is amazing thing in mobile era. And WhatsApp Status feature is great marketing and entertaining thing. But one or two my friends put nonsense things in WhatsApp status. Status mute option not enough for me and I want block their WhatsApp status in a particular period but I want to stay connect with them WhatsApp chat option only. And and my most request suggestion was WhatsApp status views count. hmm, how to tell you that,!? I repeatedly visit my favourite"
4,"When I write long status update, only 70% of it is showing after uploading it. Also, why it keeps the camera running while I browse photos to pick for story? Please fix these problems"
1,"I'm giving WHATSAPP 1 üåü, if I could I would give them 0. This app no longer shows when a person you've sent a message to has read it showing double blue ticks. Instead it remains grey. Please fix this issue???"
5,It's a great app with every feature we want. View once feature is awesome but WhatsApp should also have a feature to restrict chats like Facebook and Instagram and an automatic restriction for unknown users. Overall it's perfect.
3,App is very good and useful.. but there are some lacking points too. Majorly video/photo quality gets compressed when we add story ithat is quite irritating. Other things are negligible.
2,After the recent update the app keeps asking for backing up the data daily and there is no option to cancel it too. It is frustrating when we have to backup almost 200 MB data daily
1,"I keep losing all my chats even after backing up.. And now, the app doesn't even open anymore it just says uninstall and try again."
1,WhatsApp has got laggy for some reason. My phone is working buttery smooth but the app is lagging when I spend 15 mins in the app. Why is this happening? I'm very disappointed
2,"The new emoji menu WAS great, but now the opening animation is WAY too slow! When you are typing quickly and need to add an emoji you have to wait for the animation to finish. Previous update didn't have that animation. Please remove it again!"
1,It have misbehaving not logging my account shows your account is banned and after shows go and intall from official website and i am clicking but i have already downloaded WhatsApp.So whatsapp it was my humble request to you fix my account problem because it's important for me to conversation with others ..
1,The new channel update is annoying. Let WhatsApp a simple one to communicate only. Nobody wants to see the channel suggestions.
4,This app is fabulous. My only concern with this app is location service. Drop pin location is not accurate.
1,"Awful Sticker menu The new actualization it's very bad, there are bugs on the chat and have a significant delay at the momen to chat, the stickers menu forces to pass for all the stickers that you have and it's very uncomfortable."
1,"Complicated,asking diffrent pas word or no nogin,asking conformetion coming with other country cod, Delet complitly and restat like new. Maje.me confoused ,and l want block the refrence Thanks When i make call ""the call cudnnt connect "" The same problem not soltout .... Iwill try yo have another connection Sorr i sm not happy but l have to live you Thanks"
1,I am not satisfied with the quality related system like when I am posting a video on status the quality of my video is reduced by 60-70% by the original video. It shows blurry and very low quality video. Pls resolve this issue and get 5 star.
4,"I personally like this app, I've been using it for years. It's great but I only have one problem, due to technical limitations the iOS emoji keyboards I've installed go back to default system after sending it. I would really appreciate it if the developers could help with this problem. Thank you!"
1,"Very hard to restrict only 1 other designated caller and not your whole contact list and Whatsapp is rather persisten to want a full release of my contact list. I want to desinate only one caller to contact me. I still have not figured the charges or how i pay or when. Yes i am old and you will be some day, 81."
4,"Whenever I want to send a picture with a high quality taken from my camera S21 ultra to a chat, the whatsapp crashes, and it takes a lot of time."
3,When someone sends you a picture and you want to view it after some time they will tell you it doesn't exist on the device. I have lost important pictures and documents to that effect. Please make changes to ensure it works like that of Telegram.
2,"I've already complained but I can't send any video to anyone or put it on status, I've tried all the solutions WhatsApp asked me but I still can't do it. Every other apps are functioning perfectly so please solve this issue I've already had enough of it."
3,"with the new update, if I type a longer message, I cannot see what I write anymore in order to check any spelling etc. And when I send the message I have to manually scroll one line to see what I sent. Pretty annoying."
3,So far my experience was good until my account was being consider spam for no good reason and now I cant send and receice messages. This is really stressful and pushing me to leave the app and use any other platform which doesn't consider You as false user. Thank youüåπ *Things have changed now and i am now happy with services. Thanks*
1,For a month now ƒ± cannot listen voice messages and ƒ± even redownloaded it again it still the same. I think the last version is bugged (again)
3,"After updating this app, my WhatsApp started hanging so badly I can't even open it sometimes and it's not like I have too much contacts. Honestly this is terrible and it's really frustrating. I will be glad if something is done about it."
3,The new features are amazing but after the latest update I'm not able to send videos. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible.
5,I am so much glad to have this app. This is really helpful for me and people like me. Cause I am not that much solvent to do international phone calls as well as domestic calls to the family members for long time without this app. The quality of the service is really good. Thank you all.
1,The latest update seems to have a problem when you try to apply a filter to a photo. Instead of selecting the filter it brings up the keypad to type a message.
2,"Every update is braking things. I got new phone a week ago and I was happy that finally I could answer calls from hand's free. Today that function just broke. An year later is working but now I cannot cleanup conversations because cannot keep starred. Why star a message then? Why people mess with working things? Years now, the smile faces on web interface was left. Why in the world would an idiot move it right side making place for unused things?"
2,"Whenever I try to send or set status photo or video, it's quality drops drastically, photo's gets blure, in my phone camera app it's click very clear photo, but when I use WhatsApp to send or take a photo it's quality drops."
4,Whatsapp dark theme should be black and blue just like the iPhone version it's more easthetic and generally just looks and feels better than this grey-blue colors you put for us android users.
2,I'm having a big problem with this application it always starts afresh frequently and asked for another 6digit pin again this led to the banned of my first line and now the second one to is also facing the same thing with the first line is facing if in brief you can explain the problem I will be glad because I'm not really happy with what the app has done so far with my line reporting from experience and I need a good solution to it because that's my only way of receiving vital information thank
4,"The app is very good but after the new update,whenever i use emojis the text part jump on the top of the screen....its very disturbing and also frustrating....please make sure to adjust this problem."
1,"I keep having issues with the chat history. It does not backup to Google and I have lost information due to this three times this month because suddenly there is an error with ny chat history and I have to restore it, but there is no recent backup!! I'm not the only one experiencing this issue as a friend just told me the same thing keeps happening to them. There should be a way to backup on the computer or not having to backup at all just like Messenger or Instagram."
3,"This app is great for messaging and all but the only thing I don't like about this app is when you deleted your message but someone replied to it the previous message is still visible in the reply box. I don't want that, it'd be great if u could do an update that doesn't show the previous message in the reply box and instead it should say ""this message was deleted. "" in it. If u do an update of that I'd probably give this app a 5 star."
1,"Some technical issue in my app. I am unable to forward messages from one chat to another, it keeps on buffering and throws me out of the app saying. I use WhatsApp for important business purposes. Kindly suggest me some steps to cope this problem."
2,"(Edited 17 Jul, 2023) WhatsApp web Linking is extremely slow unlike the snappy connection Way back. B4 as soon as we scan the QR it gets connected. But now it takes a while. Not as instant as it was."
1,"I do not like the channel suggestions features, also we are not easily able to see the mute stories and also cant't search the stories of particular person, so you have to remove this update"
1,Completely not like this new update and a feature of channel. Its a messaging app. Keep it like as.
1,I want to use WhatsApp but I can't because it is not installing and not running .Only one notification is showing tap to verify your number and then I make account again next same thing happen. I have verified number and also used whatsaap 1 day before .kindly solve this issue as soon as possible.
1,Adding Channels are worst ever decesion. if you want to continue with such feature make its optional.
3,Hate the new update .... that changed status into update includes channels and everything... you can make e separate section in the broadcast part please leave the status alone
4,"Its a very nice app I love most things about it though the voice and video call needs to be upgraded to avoid all those errors, seizing and reconnections as well. Though I have a complaint regarding send of audios, you guys should make available the option of selecting audio of choice just like when I want to select a document; I have the options of going to my file manager. You should make this option available for audio as well"
2,"Simple and widely used in many countries but still unable to protect our data through its security system?! Many ppl are losing their money and data due to getting hacked by random ppl in whatsapp, and yet we're the ones who tryna find ways to resolve it instead of you as a company who provides the platform for those scammers."
1,"They have blocked my phone number for no reason. The problem has solved, they apologized for their mistake and now I have the same problem üò≠ And they don't answer to my email requests. üò•üò• I can't use WhatsApp anymore, all my conversations and pictures and a lot of audios are gone because of some incompetent workers and stupid system that blocks accounts for no reason. WhatsApp team, you are a shame !!!"
1,Photo or video quality compression in the status section is a disappointment. Unable to share at least the medium quality videos üò¢
1,"my screen turn black whenever I call or called by someone, I also can't play any voice note. please fix this, I've many things to do via whatsapp. if this trouble keeps going I would prefer to uninstall tho."
4,Hi and thanks for your good services Unfortunately we use this application under VPN because of filterin in our country. In this regard is impossible to get phonecall. It was useful two years ago. With best wishes and many successful for your team Hadi
4,An amazing app.. Please i would love it more if the sticker feature for status in iOS can also be available on Android too
1,My WhatsApp audio recorder reduces itself to just a second immediately i click the send button and I've tried all I could to solve it but couldn't and this is driving me crazy already.
1,"Pathetic customer service, never seen such incompetent staff who didn't even bother to look into the and even try to replay the emails without using template emails."
2,"There should be an option that who can contact me...like other option that who can see my profile picture, last seen or status...m feed off of uncontact wrong numbers.."
1,I am not able open the app.All of a sudden it's showing your against the terms and conditions. It was totally banned from using the app
3,This App is surprising Good and I love it! But I give it a 3 because I don't really like the emojis I mean some of them are cute and whenever my friend sends me pictures they save in my gallery and I don't really like that.
1,"Too bad ,my account got banned three consecutive times with no apparent reason for that .Maybe it's the version I've got but the system needs to be improved ,I can't rely on it when I know anytime my account can be blocked . It's so freaking unfair ."
3,"Uhm... I do not want that IOS feature. Please revoke it. Thank you. I like that the two phones have their little differences. If anything, I think us Androiders would like the opportunity to peep in the chat without actually opening the chat other than that, I do like to swipe to get to the different areas of the app, specifically to statuses. Thank you."
1,"The new emoji keyboard integration is a buggy mess and incredibly annoying, it keeps glitching up and down and making messages jump up. Please fix this, it's awful!"
2,Currently facing an issue related to viewing my own status. That particular window crashes whenever tried to open..
4,"The app is a good one but the recent update has a lot of glitches. I really love that messages can be edited even after being sent,that's the nicest feature so far"
5,"WhatsApp has been a key integrative part of my day-to-day life, as many other people can relate. It's a very simple yet intricately-created service. A simple and effective way to message and call other people (friends, family members, relatives, etc). So far I have not had any problems and everything seems to be working fine."
3,"The new update that has come in WhatsApp video call, automatic rotation, it is a completely useless update if we talk about it personally or if we talk about public review. The update of the previous version of auto rotation in whatsapp was good. You can update it manually."
2,I use WhatsApp because most people use it. But this app is not good it will take lots of storage space on your phone that you will have to constantly delete files and photos you receive from your contacts and as well as what you already have on your phone. Also they also do an update and it will not update if you don't delete tons of files on your phone. To use this app you also have to delete all the apps you already had on your phone so you will be left with only one app on your phone WhatsApp
1,"Please revert the UI, the new one is awful, takes time to load and gets strange spacings and paddings after sending quoted messages in chats, plus the new sticker setup takes ages to load. Please go back to the last uodate of this :("
1,"The new format for sending emojis, gifs and stickers SUCK! Especially the stickers section! It seems devs at Whatsapp forget the saying ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it"", either that, or they forget the dev concept of KISS, it applies to user experience too guys! Not just to your code!"
2,"Why did whatsapp change its look? Why did you change the status tabs to updates and add channels feature? I literally hate the way it is now. This is whatsapp, don't make it look like instagram. I'm already comfortable with list style like before. Please change it."
1,I'm unable to use my what's App account Because account block ... Why account Block my account I don't know and what app not given proper information to me. This is my second account block without any reason I'm sending lots of mail but given no help from your side. Very bad service... Ones your block it's blocked forever and without any reason... There is no hope from your side.... Thank you for everything
3,"Can we have the old UI back? The new update is a headache. That clean, crisp UI made it the best social media platform."
1,My whatsapp was temporaly banned but later released since then i have not been able to access my account. Instead it says un official whatsapp and i just updated it from playstore. Please help me
4,It was great and they really tried but it's just that if I select plenty people not to see my last seen and online I'll not be able to see other's own too or if I didn't allow anybody to see my last seen I won't see everyone's own too
4,I absolutely love the app! Was wondering if I can reuse my status or an option for status not to disappear after 24hrs of posting.
2,"The new update is terrible, having to swipe your keyboard up or down is unnecessary, along with having your emojies and stickers bundled up together. Let's just say, the older version is better."
4,"this is still my number one method of communicationhoweveraccessibility features needs to be improved.can get very slowespecially when using WhatsApp webalso navigation when using voice over or an external device like a keyboardfor the WhatsApp and WhatsApp web can get confusing andunnecessarilytry working on some shortcuts or gesture or give the user the opportunity to createthey're on navma V map, lovely can we not get aoption for a dialogue box to confirm before we want to callwhen adding"
4,"I will be lying if I say I don't like the way the update of the app are coming, I love them. but I have two (2)complain the first one is that, I updated my WhatsApp app today that been the latest update which required my attention and after I updated my WhatsApp, I notice that I can't edit message I sent on a chat again, pls do something to that. and the second one is that if I should call a friend 1hr ago it will be showing ""Just now"" it until I click on the call icon I will see the time"
1,"Sticker/Emoji/Gif section not working properly, especially sticker. Need to tap so many times to switch tabs also the interface isn't good. The old one was better. Need the old Sticker/Emoji/Gud interface back."
4,"I wish there was a way of deleting specific status b4 24hrs elapses eg when someone post an inappropriate, irrelevant or disturbing status, can delete it without blocking the person completely. Also try to include status saving capability within the app. I can also appreciate if background color for text statuses can be browsed from my library rather than just monocolor. Thank you. I ‚ù§ the app."
2,"Everything is good, but please don't compress videos and photos too much..... Whenever I share a status, even if it's low mbs video, WhatsApp compress it like 144p.... The worst thingüò§üò§üò†üò°... Facebook, instagram never do this but WhatsApp.... I am agree to use my mobile data on my status, agree to if may it take some long time ... But not in that wayüíîüñ§.... Please correct it......"
5,"It is the most useful app used by my friend, university, and community. But it gets tiring and confusing to search for a specific group. I have like 5 groups for class, 4 groups for community, etc. Please add a fiture that can group a pc and gc. So I can better navigate whatsapp."
1,"The update in the status is awful and these channels are absolutely irritating, and the change that happened in the stickers bar makes me mix up its place because we're used to the old place of stickers...honestly it's getting worse and worse"
1,Terrible for phone calls with headphones. The background noise is very loud then you are constantly cutting in and out. No one can hear me and its difficult to hear the other person when its busy around you.
4,"This platform has been a good one, and I will like to add on more thing, which is a group admin should be able to edit a group chat lock and a group chat opening, which will help admin to be able to control group chat access even when he is offline. Please do this fast ."
2,"Transfer of data, chats from old device to new device both registered with same phone no is not possible. When you register new device with same no, PIN and email ID than app on old one stop functioning and ask you to re- log in or vice versa . This problem arises when you go to settings>chats>transfer chats function. QR code cannot be scanned ."
4,"@whatsapp-developers it's great you added HD options of sending photos to peers, why you still didn't added this option in story, still the videos and photo upload to story goes blurr. Hope you add it soon."
1,This is so annoying why put a feature while it can be by pass I noticed this when I turned on my read receipts so that a particular person am ignoring can't knw have read their message but I was suppried when the person sent me a screenshot the I read the message already and I didn't want to reply what a big nonsense
1,1.when ever i upload photo or video in status some how the quality of picture decreases.. Please fix it. It is a very disapointing.2.i wonder that in a whatapp group suppose i have an important sms to send and read by all respectively..i need massage pin system that whoever enter the group see the pin masssage 1st.. i hope this feature come soon
1,Wouldn't let me use the app without updating once a new update drops. Only using the app because of the community otherwise Telegram is much better. They are even trying to copy telegram in video messages which telegram has been doing from so long. I would recommend a phone to a friend and I will start seeing it's ad on the phone as if they are reading your personal chats.
3,"After the new update, my phone can't connect to WhatsApp Web. It's keep 'logging in'...and at the end...it says: can't logging in. check your internet connection while my connection is fine."
1,With the new update we are going to have more ads and all in future and the app has actually lost what it initially stood for. Thanks meta for selling our data and information and using it for ur personal revenue
1,"For the past 2 or 3 weeks, I'm having issue of my account been logged out from my device while my account is banned. I never get involve in fraudulent or inproper activities with my account. I ensure that i implement all security setting to protect my account. Please try to resolve this issue."
1,"Getting to a month now fraud stars tamperd with my acount, since then i cant retrieve my account again i provide my email when i did my two step verification, which should be easy for me as imformation says and seven days without email till now i am not getting any help or assistance from app developer So the imformation you drop over there is fake or what. I you dont retrieve lost account you better tell the world"
3,"Whatsapp is a great app but they really have to upgrade their quality when you post on ""Status"". When posting on Status the image/video quality decreases to where you can see pixels and these pixels weren't their before."
3,"Always use WhatsApp its great for sending photos & attachments for free. Well it was until today when myself & hubby can now only send text messages without photos or attachments! Can't receive MMS either now. Tried rebooting router, tried turn phones on and off, still nothing. We are with Sky mobile & they say there's nothing wrong at their end. Have tried to contact WhatsApp through chat but they are not replying now!"
5,"Dear WhatsApp Support Team, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I have been experiencing with the group description feature on WhatsApp. I recently created a group and added a group description to provide context and information to the members. However, despite adding the description, none of the group members are able to see it when they open the group chat. This is causing confusion and hindering effective communication within the group."
5,It's really really really really really really a good app. Easy to both signup and login . No ads and it's not data consuming. But you guys should like bring a feature to edit status thoüëÄüò≥
1,Quality of videos uploaded to status is terrible. It's annoying. Videos are meant to be high quality that are uploaded on status and we get some random moving pixels as status in return. Disappointed.
1,Worst update ever ! You have totally ruined the platform by adding channel atleast give some option in the interface to disable it or hide it as per the need .
3,Previous style of status is very excellent but new look with channel is worst. Kindly look into the matter.
1,"WhatsApp's new sticker system is very very bad. It is to much unorganised and hard to find out any specific sticker. We have to scroll up all the way up and down to find any sticker. I'm requesting to team WhatsApp, please make a solution of it. Thank you."
4,"Good app. You should add a function that allows user to control the duration of his or her own status, e.g 12 hour status, 8 hour 24 hour e.t.c,"
1,Awful on desktop Can download files all at once even when you copy them they are wrong all have the same name. Bring back the old one and stop trying to take everything the user can do away. Recommend getting a different app
3,All updates which are coming r good but one update which I personally want is that the timing of status should be increased from 30 seconds to 1 minute.. so we can have a continuation of videos.. Hoping u will look into it nd bring something like this..
1,"I hate the new emoji keyboard taking over the chat! Pls do NOT roll it out and how do I stop being a beta tester and how do I get my old settings back!!! I am pretty sure I did not give permission for my phone and settings to be accessed and changed without my knowledge or consent! And if it""s in the ""general terms"" without being specific - it is and underhanded practice!!!"
3,When the app is update i have problem üòë üò£üòí facing in status Option When i uploaded 30 second ya below down 30 second video After that it is not properly time playingüòí 10-15 or 20 second missing why 30 second status successful upload after that not playing 30 second Any time missing second
1,"My account was hacked and after retrieving, If I want to verify my account number, it will show sending an email, instead of sending SMS, and I will get a pop up message that says, I need the official WhatsApp to use this account number but I downloaded it from Google play store (both WhatsApp messenger and WhatsApp business gives me the same pop up message) please I need an help to solve it."
2,"the new app on laptops are really bad. They send really slowly compared to whatsapp on the phone. They keep crashing and you cant crop pictures there. Please let me use the old app, it's betterüíÄüíÄüíÄ"
4,I mean I really enjoy this app. But there is one problem which is the video call quality. It is not impressive but the rest I am really happy about.
4,It should have a logout button now! It used to be more of a professional tool but it's becoming more and more unprofessional with Meta introducing channels now ü§¶
3,"Each time I try to use this app,my account keep getting suspended,even after reinstalling it,the same issue all the time....pls you guys should fix it...I don't have any other issue aside from the one already mention.And I wish to continue using this service..I am already getting tired.."
1,I don't like the new version. WhatsApp is something which revolves around our personal life. If there also we are gonna add celebrities and remain indulged for another couple of hours then what difference it's gonna have with other socialising app? Previous version was far better. Not happy with new version.
1,"the previous version is better because the current version is getting more complicated and sometimes when I'm on the phone, I want to watch a video and there's no sound at all, but after I'm done on the phone , there's sound its only when in a call there's no sound"
1,"Hate the new hidden feature. I am unable to see when my kids if they are online in the middle of the night. Plz remove this feature for all time to come. Too much of privacy leads to aloneness and leads a person to do ,which he is not supposed to do. Why do we keep CCTV cameras...only to keep an eye if something unwanted is not happening but others also know that they are being watched ..so a crime is also stopped in that way. Kindly remove this feature plz."
3,There is a technical glitch when I try to trim the second half of my video to status. It automatically takes the first part again. üò°üò°üò°üò°
1,"There was no need for channel features in WhatsApp. Ever since this new feature came, I am feeling very uncomfortable, I have to hide it again and again."
3,"Hi Team, Whatsapp video call appears green background color when speaking to another person. I don't know what's the issue is. Please let me know."
1,The worst Update ever made by WhatsApp!!! The emoji section makes it hard to navigate. Return to the old layout please. Useless Update ever.
3,"The was quite well before. But for the last 1 month my account is being banned for no reason. After a request, it is unbanned. But again banned after a while. This has been constantly happening. And now after the last request you have permanently banned it. I have sent email, but no response. Please respond."
1,"My WhatsApp shows dates completely wrong and I tried all the possible ways such as reinstalling it, change my phone date and time setting and everything and still doesn't work. Also when I put Status it disappears after like 10 minutes and I don't know what to do with this much problem I got with it. It's ofcourse updated to the last version from Google play. I sent message to the Help and they just randomly answered something completely irrelevant to my problem. I'm really disappointed."
5,I appreciate you for bringing lock system but you should bring more security like password setting to lock an app because by misleading our fingerprint anyone can use our WhatsApp you should bring lock and password system
4,"So... overall it's not bad. But 1 thing that is a little unintuitive, that on your chest history list, all contracts are bold, so it is difficult to tell when some1 sends you a new chat. O.k. Other apps, only new chats are bold, & read messages are not. This is a, bit annoying, because it always makes me think that I have a ton of new messages, & then an frequently disappointed when I realize that it doesn't mean that. I know this now, but is still annoying."
1,"I hate the way stickers are now showing, it takes time to load all of them (before wasn't taking time) I need to click on a sticker section 5 times to show everything"
4,It's a amazing app .but the recently upgrades can put in like navigation changes and new channel creating etc
4,"Could you please add a function that PROHIBITS all incoming calls, except for some numbers. I use silent function but still so many spam callers - so bothering"
5,It is the only useful messenger which helps people to share the ideas specifically in business. But I am not share it is fully safe or not so far.
5,Recently make a voice call often black screen and disconnect. I have to press button and hold it for a moment to switch back to application otherwise black screen.
3,"In-app calls have been malfunctioning lately. I can't hear the other party clearly and vice versa. Haven't been able to make calls for a while now, please fix it."
1,"My WhatsApp has been having a glitch, I can't view my status well without it pausing and the sound still playing. It just started of recent. Please, I need you to resolve it. Thanks"
1,The latest update is the worst! Why is it like Instagram? Somethings are better when they are simple and easy. Please take this update back!
1,"Bring back the old sticker, gif, emoji tray...this new update sucks.... cannot scroll gif.... The previous look was much more handy....whats the need to change everything?"
4,"Hey, the only media i use for communication is whatsapp . I would recommend whatsapp to have a chat edit option which can prevent the user from being awkward. Instead of correcting the message through this (*) the user can directly edit their chats!!! I would love to give it five stars If u update this option... Thank you"
1,Tried to sned videos but it failed. Same goes to whatsapp status. I restarted everything but still same problem occured. What is this update? The worst update so far.. before this i don't have issues sending video to my friends or posting on WhatsApp status
4,Can you add checklist feature? You just recently blasted an add for todolist but we cant know whether we have done it or not without the tick box.
5,"Great as a chat app. So it compresses photos? Well, if I want to share big files, I use a cloud site. Easy to send someone a web link, and YouTube links play in the app without ads!! üòé It doesn't jam for me, but I don't back it up online which simplifies things. Voice & video calls work well (as well as my wi-fi allows anyway üôÑ) other than the mic sticking 'off' sometimes. Thankfully found I could shrink the new widget down to the 3x2 size I like. Where would I be without WhatsApp?! üòÅüëçüèª"
4,"I updated my watsapp and can no longer hide some chats again. The way watsapp updates and remove beautiful features is just crazy, pls bring back that feature cos it's wonderful.."
1,"The new update in the status option is very ridiculous, there are unnecessary option of following channels which is very awfull."
1,New update is worst. Not able to search status. (Search option is gone. From status). And new Status system is I didn't liked
1,Not able to sign in It is not able to send SMS for the OTP One of the worst security system I am not able to sign in and if I try to the time keeps extending by 1hr extra for a retry either for SMS or call for OTP Now if says I have to wait for another 7hrs for the next try to sign in. I hope this issue gets resolved ASAP.
1,My account number was blocked mistakenly and I've been trying to access it several days now and it's still inaccessible. Kindly fix that problem
1,"Despite all these YEARS, the report option is still useless against scammers (claim to be Samsung/Apple reps while using numbers with Indian area code) with blocking still being only the real thing that can be done, as they can STILL send malicious links & download files. Still cannot set app to use external SD card as it always bloats device storage. There are actual apps that are reliable like Discord or Line. Sadly everyone still uses whatsap because it's a ""Facebook product"". Terrible app."
1,"WhatsApp always been easy to use and simple. But the new emoji keyboard is really pathetic, that adjustable button is really very disgusting. I suggest you to not add this adjustable keyboard and keep it simple as it was."
3,Can whatApp give the group admin the option when removing a participant from a group page. WhatApp will delete the page of the removed participant. So that the page does not stay on the remove participant's phone . This is necessary in an era where scammers hack on to people's number and access the hacked's groups. So the scammer does not see the numbers of other participants and use for anonymous messaged later on.
3,"Deleted message cant be shown by any means. (This message was deleted) option also sholud remove. Like telegram, there should be no understanding of deleted messages."
3,Fantastic app...no doubt in that... But recently i am felting some trouble related to location sharing feature. I can't share location to anyone.. everytime i tried it just go for retry... please consider this and help regarding this... thank you üòä
1,"New update of WhatsApp which has the option of editing messages. This update is very wrong. Because of all this date, because of the message edit, 3 people have been removed from our company because they edited and corrected something wrong and put one of our employees as a liar. Please how do you remove the edited update, this is very wrong?"
2,I found whatsapp status updation quality issue. I continuously mail to support centre from a week with screen recording. But there is no any positive answer came from support centre side. I am using whatsapp from last 10 years. 1st time i faced such a issue. Pls resolve it.
1,"Keeps using my permissions in the Background. I hav removed alot of times, still leep using it in the background. What is this nonsense Also, keeps closing and stops working when i search a chat. It's freaking annoying"
3,"It is a good app for the rest of the conversation, but whenever someone puts a photo and video status or sends it to someone, its quality becomes very poor."
5,Your app is amazing. I love the way it is so private and convenient. But I have a suggestion. Can you guys create a feature where you react on someone's status without sending it to his DM. Because sending the reaction to the person's DM will lead to a conversation at good or bad times. I hope my idea is put in to consideration üòäüòÅ
5,"its very nice app but i am just facing a problem the ticks that indicates the message have been seen or not even if person has seen the tick don¬¥t turn blue, i request to please solve this problem"
1,No privacy. Doesnt make sense if people want to edit. They could just rewrite or cancel their messages. This app can cause manipulation using messages. No safety for user at all.
1,"Add some animations in the app like while sending a message etc, app feels like jittery while chating. Telegram has god animations, it's high time that you added some animations to make the app smooth."
3,"It's one of the best app to contact friends and family it really amazing , just some I have some problems to install it we I need to update,but still yet really good üëΩüíö"
5,Very good app only problem i face its data transfar only phone memory and it full plz u change format. data goes on external memory
1,"All my media gone!!!!, Stop telling me""sorry, this media file doesn't exist on your internal storage."" !!! You delete it!!! And backup don't even bring it back!!! What's even the point of backing it up!!! Asking everyday and don't even works when needed!!!"
1,Whatsapp used to be perfect and now it's gotten so complicated and is constantly changing. I see they've added Facebook too which sucks. There should be a minimalist option which is simple and without forced updates
1,"Was a decent app. But lately, I have been getting notified of messages that are being sent, but when I go to check them, the messages are not there. The last messages I have are from almost a week ago. And people are sending me messages in Facebook of screenshots from the group chats in whatsapp that I'm not even getting. And yes, the app is up to date. I have reinstalled the app numerous times. And made sure the app is caught up on updates. And the app has been backed up and nothing."
3,Good app for messaging. Need to implement few new options. 1. Self whatapp account holder contact number should reflect in chats. We can save those messages in self contact chat. 2. Pictures clarity is missing when someone sending pictures
1,"Please note this one more bug or glitch, when I open any pre recorded voice or my own recorded voice to listen, my whole screen blackout. I need to restart my mobile or need to hold power button for a long. Please fix this. Thanks fo you attention."
4,I use this all the time and it's safe and I like it ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèª i found some difficulties right now suddenly WhatsApp is showing that my actions goes against their terms and conditions but I don't know suddenly what happened i even used my WhatsApp account much today .
1,I've bought Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and downloaded WhatsaApp companion app from Play Store. Incoming call alerts are not coming on watch and don't have call option.. Please help.
5,Video message added and video/sound lock system in place to record rather than pressing the mic! Countless of fragmented voice messages avoided. Thanks!!!
1,"I cannot log in into my new phone, and already had logged out from the old one, i've been trying since the last 4 hours continuosly waiting, because it wanted to take 1 hour before resending me a sms, but then, it doesn't send, so had to wait 1 more hour, and another and then another, like what the hell is this?????"
5,The WhatsApp messenger is lite in performance. The app can be an conduit for illegal activities sincerely by allowing call mode.thats why they give it a limited time for calls for emergencies. The app can be issued with access to groups in flea markets where they can form a community premium at certain calls neither from international nor from regional and grassroots groups.before reducing the low rates they should increase the pressure on the app not to close or crash midway in use.
1,Now I am scared of using this application..as I have heard and read about how they are playing with privacy policies. Can someone from team revert me regarding this and clarify this? Response awaited!! I think Mark team is not interested to revert someone's query. Great job team whats app for not replying.
4,"Really and usefu app ofr quick and real time communicotion l,ll suggest that a way shovld be made to retrieve deleted voice notes l ve hed theunfortun the incident of the can cel button after recording a voice note abd al as all i ve usibg said goes the concep button atter rocording a voice not and al us all i ve sand goes down avitruanbin"
5,It is good and a part of life but why I am I not able to watch my vedio on status...? It plays only for 5 seconds and then pause.... it's been happening since a long time . I update it too. But every vedio gets paused so something please
1,"WA used to be great. The past month and a half while texting still functions, phone calls are useless. Has WA joined yt and twitter and fb as wokers. Now requires an update every 2 or 3 days? Good platforms becoming useless?üá∫üá≤"
1,"Those reactions are really annoying. They are obstructive since they are located at the top of the reply/message. I always accidentally hit them. Take the reactions away or make them less obtrusive. Also, the new version is buggy: the camera is buggy, the frame is small, and I can't edit my photos"
2,The new update very irritating. It can be estimated that this app is going to cotain ads which is too worst thing. The WhatsApp should not contain ads üòû.
1,Go back too the previous updates gifs are broken like the gif and emoji tray wont scroll without loading and it reverts too default constantly. Then CRASHES
1,Iam felling very angry about what's app because it is simply popping up a message and showing your account has been spammed .And then when I made another account it is showing the same pop-up SMS. Iam trying to recover but this is saying use another app. Please make my both account like earlier. Fast.
2,Please revert back the emoji/gif/sticker selector with the tabs on the bottom. It is really difficult to select the recently used stickers because it interferes with the system gestures
5,"It is already an established fact that whatsapp offers an amazing platform of communication if not the best. My only request as of now is: can we just get a WhatsApp Emoji? As funny as this may sounds, a handfull of users will find it very useful. Thanks team."
4,"Channels should appear in a separate tab. Status looks ugly and not interesting to view. You can't search for status to view. Either your allow disable channel,or you put in a different tab just like communities. Thank you."
5,Im happy to use whatsapp I have insight to modify it as how we are keeping status just like that we can add voice songs which is to be inbuild in the application so that we can choose song from their itself...if .this changes will made.. We will be more satisfaction üòÉ
4,"I love the app, I do, but I want face id unlock available for android devices, not only fingerprint as sometimes the fingerprint doesn't get recognised which prevents us from opening whatsapp. So I highly recommend adding face ID unlock for android devices. Thanks."
1,"Hello I lost my hole data of my phone by mistakenly so I recoverd it all it was not the problem it was not log in again in Whatsapp it was asking phone number I have given it, their is some problem with my sms so I haven choosed ph call to me it was saying I did not found that type of phone number later it has accepted it but it was saying to wait for 50 min it some urgency for me, not only me any other people suffering with this problem so please reduce the time that's my request ."
1,"Hii WhatsApp Team, Getting issues while logging to WhatsApp, getting this particular error ""You need the official WhatsApp to use this account"" After clicking on ""open WhatsApp"" button it is redirecting us to the playstore. Please look into this issue, I have also tried mailing, however got no response. It will be great help if I will get any assistance for my issue. Thanks"
1,"Although I set the microphone access only when the app is in use, however, I noticed that even when the app is not in use still it's accessing my phone microphone. Why? I can provide the screenshots if option is given to upload. My Google pixel 7 can notify me whenever any app is trying to use microphone."
5,"Let me start by saying WhatsApp is a great piece of tech! Especially for businesses that use it to chat with clients, share documents, updates, etc. It has checked so many boxes that it may seem like a challenge to improve further, but I believe a simple addition would do just the trick. Adding folders to WhatsApp! This would be an ability for users to group clients, friends, family, and construct sections based on their own needs. Decluttering the workspace and allowing for more productivity."
3,Keypad is changed completely it is very irritating to use whatsapp emoji stickers etc..now a days...pls bring the old version of keypad
2,When we put status the quality of video or image becomes worst.. fix it ..please also add hide chat option. That's the only feature whatsapp is lacking
3,I am very disappointed to see WhatsApp popup notifications for OnePlus 11G mobile it won't show any content please fix this bug or functionality as soon as possible.
1,I'm not sure when it was taken away...but the option to video message in the little round circle is not there anymore???ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2,"Latest update is very bad because there are many public channel are being shown by WhatsApp like famous people and everytime it disturb me, so give an update ( option) to hide or remove this feature then I will give you 5 Star ‚≠ê‚≠ê"
1,"new emoji layout is frustrating. I am used to old style, and do allow us as an option to use system emojis."
3,"personal messages and calls to friends and family are end-to-end encrypted. No one outside of your chats, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen"
4,"It's a good app were you can text , call and Facetime your friends as and family the only annoying thing I'll s that some people like scammers pop up into your DMs but you can just delete them"
1,"During Video Call, the notification of the call keeps coming after every 20 seconds, which is annoying after the Update, hope they fix this"
1,Fix the calling issues. The video quality sucks even when you have high-speed internet and are very blurry also thi sound is all clustered and can't really hear the other person.
4,It a great experience but also willing to see continues improvement as technology has moved in to a competitive level
3,"It is getting good, i nice to see a good quality pic, but how about the video quality, btw, it would be nice if we could have 2 phone numbers on 1 app(2acc) sync on. Please consider"
1,Unable to restore backup. Its not a choice for whom values their previous chat history. Its a mammoth task for those people to keep the old chat history while switching a mobile phone or resetting mobile phone or simple uninstall and reinstall of whatsapp. No one can guarantee the chat history. Note : Simply switch to better alternatives.
1,I don't know if my phone is broken or what but on my whatsapp they added a channel feature and it's such so annoying it completely changed my whatsapp and I hate it.
1,There is bug in status viewing. It takes to much time to open status pictures or videos.
1,"In this what's app chat,status,call plots were in the bottom. It changed its layout without my permission. It's very bad , I was preferring to complain but don't know where to complain. Please I want the old layout."
5,It is very helpful for each and every people for privacy.. because WhatsApp is such a App to communicate in a better way and helps us a lot and easier.
1,"I've been using Whatsapp for nearly a decade because I have friends and family in different countries. It's been fantastic to be able to video with my loved ones. As of the last update a couple of days ago, It will not open. I've reinstalled it multiple times without success. Support says that the problem is with the Google Play Store. I hope it gets fixed soon."
4,"The chat privacy feature has been implemented but i aint satisfied yet. The main purpose of my complaint from my last review has not been initiated. I'm more concern about the link devices, same features need to be implemented on linked devices."
3,"Please give a seperate tab for Groups, so that all groups are automatically siphoned there and we don't have to search through chats to find different group!!!! Many times we forget the name and we have to keep scrolling to find that one group. This will make lives easier! üôè"
4,Overall veerrry good. Just find a way to make it possible for an individual to send a message to another without having first to save their contacts if they're not on your contact list & don't want them there.
5,I like this but you devloped chat lock it's very nice but if anyone know our screen lock password they will unlock it then what is the use of it. Remove the option unlocking with screen password
4,"Please can you add a wall paper change to WhatsApp, so that when you quickly open the app instead of the white background is either your picture or something üôèüò≠"
1,"I can't even get an SMS or call to sign in it just doesn't ever send a code or call... I never used the app, so that's my only input"
1,"I like this app for messaging only. However when I want to share video of more than 16mb size, this app doesn't allow. This sucks. Perhaps Pro version should be introduced where the above mentioned issue is resolved. I don't mind paying for such Pro version if introduced. My request to friends out there. Do you know of any Apps which allows larger sized video to transfer via the messaging apps."
1,"Number verification process is so disastrous! I can't register my number to my new device, saying that; ""You have tried many times, wait for 24 hours"" after 24 hours I requested it again and it was still adding more hours than before. Please try to do some legitimate fixations against it."
1,"Wow, META just doesn't know when to stop!! This is why I stopped using Facebook for the last 10 years and never will again. The constant changes they make seem like a bunch of middle school students trying to play programmer.... The new emoji and sticker shelf is completely broken now! When you tap the emoji icon and the emoji shelf comes up, your entire chat scrolls up to the top 20% of the screen, with a huge BLANK gap inbetween your chat and the emoji shelf. Unbelievable!!"
2,It is one of the best app to chat with others. But their help center is very bad.This is the fourth day and they are not able to fix my problem. My Whatsapp was banned for 24 hours because i have used any other unofficial WhatsApp which was my bad.But even after this duration of punishment i couldn't get access to my account.They are keep on saying that you have to use official WhatsApp to get access even though i am using the official one.I have sent an application but they didn't respond me.
3,"The new whatsapp update is a load of rubbish, proritizing channels (taking 80%of screen size) over my friends status I find it hard. Following them on Whatsapp too crowds my personal space"
1,Videos status updates not post 30 seconds like it should be. My posts 30 seconds of videos only like 5 seconds got posted. Fix this problem guys.
2,"After recent update, there is jo search bar in status option after it changed into updates and after subscribing the channels status are shown in horizontal rows, that give worse interface."
3,"I've been facing 2 problems after the latest update. 1. Videos aren't loading whether they're sent by a contact or put by them in status. It won't load at any cost. 2. Whenever I pick images as a document to send to a contact, it'll only pick first image & leaves the rest of the images I selected. Didn't expected these kind of bugs from WhatsApp."
1,"my whatsapp is not receiving any message.. have updated it, reinstalled restart my device but still facing the same error .. please tell me how can I fix it."
1,"From 5 star to 1 star just bcz of the new update that turned WhatsApp to Instagram, we want it to be simple, kindly provide a way to keep the previous story visuals back, I don't want to see these channels"
2,"Losing the simplicity. The new update grouped the community chats and does not have any utility. It's the same as the extra community tab. Plus you cannot mark the community as read, and now you need 2 clicks to read a chat instead of one. UX really needs a check"
1,New layout is awful. It was better with calls/status etc was along the top. Now it's at the bottom which looks awful. Not happy at least give us layout options.
4,How can i turn off the function in which when i play an audio in chat and accidentally light sensor of mobile covered and the sound goes to ear speaker from loud speaker.. plz add a setting to turn off this function.. Thank you
5,"So user friendly, very simple to use. However I think adding a pinned status would be cool And also having to put the amount of time needed for a status to displayed"
5,"This app is useful but it scamed me today. ""Yay! It's WhatsApp's birthday! If you send this message to 12 people, you get 120 new emojis. How cute! (It works) üåàThis is an official WhatsApp message... WhatsApp celebrates its 11th birthday! You will get a colorful keyboard, if you send this message to 25 people, Attention: not one more, not one less! ‚ö†Ô∏è Hurry the deadline is limited to one week ‚ö†Ô∏è It is done ? Look at your keyboard.üòâ I did all but I did not get anything."
1,"What's app varification OTP is not coming in my phone and I have sent many mails to what's app support but my issue is not resolved ,.... Don't download this app"
1,Not having best service because my old phone cannot transfer to other phone by using transfer chats.. It is also not working at all an I'm disappointed on it
1,"Worse than malware. This app won't Uninstall after freezing multiple times. I can't use it! I don't want to use it! Get OFF MY PHONE Edit: After freezing my installer package app and refusing to be unintalled via settings, I learned you have to go into back into the play store to unintall. Also, check ALL PERMISSIONS setting for this app- seriously as good as malware with what it can control without your consent. Terrible mistake to give it a shot."
5,"Great app, but please can you make the archived chats to appear at the bottom of all unarchived chats as it was back back then. Thank you"
3,"This was one of my favorite apps, but they keep changing the format of the home screen and they make it worse. Why is the status bar last and you have to click and can't swipe through pages anymore. The icons for chats, statuses and calls are HUGE on the screen now and it ruins the whole look. Please change it back, since the first loom was way better and out of the way."
1,"Uploading videos decrease the overall performance. I'm using WhatsApp for many years now, and I have never experienced such bad user experience with uploading videos until recently. It looks like the phone is getting stuck when I choose a video to upload to the conversation. This such behaviour never happened before and it might be from the lastest updates."
1,"My chat all were gone suddenly, and it's look like when we bought new phone. All of the chat are important to me and i couldn't recover all the chat. I also didn't turn on back up mood (which is my fault) but it shouldn't suddenly make all my chat gone for nothing. Still hasn't found how to get all the chat backkk"
3,You add channel but if someone is not interested then how can we remove tha font of channel before update we saw status smoothly but there is channel which I don't I like it plz give us an option to remove the suggestions of channel
1,Just Hated the Channel feature the most coz it's unwanted things are very much distracted such as Insta and FB. Remove this unwanted feature.
4,What's app is very useful for everyone.but now a days mostly giving updates....... One thing you are not Absorving? In the WhatsApp status filters not working..... I'm Absorving since 3 month.... Please update.....?
1,"That new emoji and sticker ui, that just sucks. Buggy at most time. Its just reset everytime i press a sticker. And i have to pull it up, to make it larger to view everytime i press a sticker. Please make this interactive ui keyboard an option instead of forcing it."
5,Excellent product. Thanks guys! Please add an option to remove 'Channels'. I'm not interested!
1,I'm very much upset as WhatsApp was the only private app for me but now why including channels we already get a lots of information from Facebook Instagram and many other apps please remove this feature of include channels we don't need this please üòî
4,It will be good if you can add a feature where we can pin minimum 5 contact or groups it'll be very helpful. But this app is really good if we can rate it in 1 to 10 scale then I'd give 9.5 out of 10 .
1,"I hate this new update.. the place where the sticker changes, there is no status search that has been seen, the quality of the pictures and videos sent is not HD. create a system to see old messages to people who have just joined the group. Please Whatsapp"
5,I really love this app it helps me chat with friends and family from all over the world I really like this app I don't think they are any issues and hope more great apps like this will be createdüòÅ
3,Please delete the recent update of channels. That is irritating. Give the off option for people who doesn't need this updateü•¥
1,Pethatic application from past 4-5 days someone is logged in my WhatsApp and I am unable to login WhatsApp is just giving errors that you have tried so many time but I haven't tried more then one-time and there is no support or complaint centre for WhatsApp also plz do not install this unsecured application.
1,"My screen keeps going off whenever I try playing a voice note, and it happens even when I don't keep the phone close to my face and each time it happens, the volume reduces drastically and then I can't hear the voice note anymore unless I take it real close to my ear, it's really frustrating"
4,"EDIT: 05.05.23 ""Side by Side View"" is now able to be toggled in settings. This choice improves the experience on high resolution phones. Developers have listened - THANK YOU. Star rating updated to reflect this change. Split View has ruined what used to be a really functional App. Please provide a toggle for high-resolution phone users to be able to turn off Split View as it's poorly thought through and unworkablevb"
2,Good when it works. 90 percent of my time with this app has been deleting storage for the app to even work. I only have 100 photos in my album yet every other week I have to delete some to make this app work. Sometimes after doing that it still says to delete more.
1,"I dont even understand why did after a frequent update, my profile picture always removed by itself. fix this whatsapp, i've had enough with this."
3,"Well this is awkward... WhatsApp is telling me I need to update the app in the next 3 days to be able to continue using it, and I see all these recent reviews saying the latest update has brought really significant problems that weren't there before... So what am I to do? The app generally works pretty well and is very useful. I'll be very disappointed if it becomes more frustrating to use through an update I'm basically forced to get."
1,I am unable to see my WhatsApp call logs ... Sometimes it show correct call logs and sometimes the call log is not visible in the log history... Please resolve this issue
1,"New channel update is worst.... We all consider WhatsApp as a private message platform but by this you made it social media site as like others (fb,insta). We don't want this feature we already have other platforms."
4,the status update is good but can you make it that the quality doesn't drop? Also can make the status where you can change the sound/audio with our own file? if you can do it we totally appreciate it.
5,"**new whatsapp update: The Issue is fixed, Thank you !! The new updates had caused WhatsApp unable to display message in small window mode for Honor Devices especially Honor Magic 5 Pro. However, WhatsApp works fine in split-screen. Please fix this ASAP. Thanks in advance."
5,"App is awesome , features added on every update is cool , the screen sharing feature was really helpful for me , but with recent update it went away . Can screen sharing feature come back again ???"
2,When using videocall if you get a popup call or you go to your homepage in a certain way it breaks the video. So your camera no longer works and it only works if you go back into the call full screen and press on your video and then the other person's video and then yours again and stay looking at yourself otherwise it stops working again. This is a new bug as this didn't happen before the update. If this could be fixed then that would be great as it is really frustrating.
5,"WhatsApp has been a great app for communication, fun and so much more so far, but I will please like the developers to work more on our privacy for instance if you are in a WhatsApp group and wants to be anonymous reading the messages without being noticed it will be great, like developing a read receipt for groups only that u could just turn off not like a general setting stuffüôèbut always WhatsApp is still #1"
2,"WhatsApp is definitely my favorite daily app to message people. But please devs, increase photo and video quality whenever uploading to status or sending video to anyone. Yes, I'm aware that there's an option to send the best quality, but it still too low. Whenever me or someone sends a photo / video with small texts, it's so blurry and you barely see anything. Also I can't text anyone whenever doing a video call, so kindly fix it. We all know WhatsApp can do better than this."
5,Wonderful app especially for video chat and the most important part is the security and privacy features built into this app. Thank you very much!!!!
1,Add disable features for those celebrity channel. I want my watsapp to stay minimum with less status drama. May be then would change ratings. It was private before and better than now
5,"I don't like this new upgrade, status are now below, and it makes it tiring to view status, I'd prefer if there's status and there's channels. But remove that updates it makes WhatsApp boring."
1,"The damn app is spamming ""WhatsApp isn't responding"". Even though it's working just fine. Other than this spamming issue."
1,"I have not been able to use whatsapp for months. Whenever I tried to have access,it will send me a message saying I must verify my number. How do I do that, please help."
3,"Whatsapp is changing many features like Share, Starred Msg every few days. Backup features also are not consistent."
1,"Although whatsApp has been one of the most important social media for me, after every update the features are declining and getting worse day by day. I don't understand why they have to make WhatsApp like Instagram. They both are different platforms. It was really fun to chat using emojis and stickers but now it has become difficult to choose the stickers and emojis. We really expected WhatsApp to be better than this but all we can ssee now is the continuous lagging and declining features in it."
3,"Good. Everyone is using it. Except one thing. Whenever i try to post a video on Updates, it will post the wrong segment of video. It's annoying. Please fix it"
1,Every update makes the platform worse. Please bring back notifications for when a chat is muted. Why do I have to go in and check each time. I want to see there is a message but don't want to hear it; hence the word mute.
5,"I don't like the features of following celebrities and automatically hide all status of my friends, WhatsApp is different from other applications so you don't mix it. Instagram, Twitter and so many applications are enough to following celebrities, pls don't involve WhatsApp in there ."
2,Account being blocked frequently without a valid reason Every time getting reply system error while pursuing the matter Needs to address the issue once for all since no breach of terms of agreement
2,This new update is so much annoying these Whatsapp channels are annoying plz don't do this üò°üò≠ normal Whatsapp without this feature is best I hope Whatsapp team u will fix this soon! üôè Thanks
1,"It takes forever to backup. The lat time I backed up was April 28th, 2023 (I use the option of ONLY BACK UP WHEN I CLICK BACKUP, and I haven't been able to back up again afterwards. It just shows backing up and keeps booting but it will be there for hours until I switch off my phone. I would have deletedbtue app and reinstalled but I don't want to lose any of my chats. It's saddening. Blessing"
2,"Who do I no longer get pop up notifications? Now I have to keep checking to see if someone has messaged me.. Popup setting is greyed out and says not available on my version (brand new phone on Android V13). We use this for work, so it is very annoying"
4,WhatsApp is increasing excitement continuously. I recommend to provide an option to categorise chats like option to make folders within chat and to move messages.
1,I own s22 ultra .. but i cant see any change in my whatsapp despite having latest version of whatsapp .. there is no latest smiley section and also there is no screen recording feature ... other low budget phones have every single feature of latest version.. and let me remind they are not using beta version either
1,Phone without fingerprint sensor not supporting chat lock please fix this as soon as possible. Password pattern should be there for us who do not have fingerprint sensor in their device. My device is Real me c3
1,"Please take away the new update, leave the status the way it was before.... The new update is bad, I want only my contact list and not some channels on whatsapp, I can easily do those on whatsapp..... Leave whatsapp and stop all this update"
5,"Best messaging app! Introduce features to hide the notification in chats (both personal and group) for deleted messages, to delete old messages for everyone (in personal chats as well as group chats) and allow us to edit messages even after fifteen minutes later as well."
5,"The app is totally great , it never gives me any complication. On my last whatsap I had problems with video calls but now I can video call and it's on a good condition I even thought my phone's front camera until this whatsap showed me it's not . I highly doubt Whatsapp Messenger ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"
4,Change the location of the channels stuff to where the community is. And leave the status the was it was....It's making the status very annoying..
4,"I use WhatsApp all the time and I really enjoy using it, I just think it lacks a few features. First it would be great if we could pin messages in groups and private chats, second it would be great if we could individually turn our cameras on in a call without requesting to switch to a video call, and third it would be great if we could edit our messages that are already sent. But either way I rly like it and I actualy made alot of people to switch from viber to whatsapp because I like it more."
1,"Not able to use watsapp, not receiving any messages, not getting updates on my sent messages, take immediate action regarding this."
1,"Really poor UX design, ~30% of the horizontal span of the screen wasted on a column of repeating profile pictures too small to be of any use, and then an empty column on the other side ""to make the text centered"". Useless and frustrating. The world is on a downward trend if this is the generation to design the next iteration of things"
4,"Best messaging app. Would recommend it to anyone, unless you don‚Äôt want strangers messaging you. But then again, no worries because you can block (and delete) strange numbers. Just found out that I can‚Äôt send videos longer than 3 minutes. If that is true and remains that way, it'll be the only thing I hate!"
3,"Now, we can't see the list of statuses we've sent. It will save us time checking what we've posted if that feature is returned"
4,"The features are very useful. However, since the most important feature of 'call recording' is not there, cunning and scrupulous people take advantage of this while making calls relateing to forgery, cheating, misleading or threatening etc. So as to avoid such things and for the sake of humanity this may be reviewed seriously and call recording features must be provided as early as possible."
4,This is the best app for chatting and i just want to suggest a change that we need an option for chatting privately on groups without going to his/her contact by selecting who can see this certain message just like zoom meeting chats.
4,After 3 year's of use WhatsApp and now I have writt my review pros:--- ¬π. User experience are snappy ¬≤. Use to different like this types of WhatsApp are very good platform 3. Data usage and overall experience are good 4. No security problems ex:- end to end encrypt Cons are :- ¬π. video call quality are not good for night situation ¬≤. Photo shareing no hd option available
1,"Worst communication app ever developed by a human being. I decided to uninstall this app and replace it by telegram. All family and friends will do the same - A Dieu Whatsapp, welcome telegram"
1,"Horrible ! I'm trying to delete my account and it doesn't let me.It says unable to connect ,please try again later.This is just wrong .I've been sitting here since 30 min and trying to delete my account. Please be aware ,that once you open the account on whatsapp you won't be able to delete your account and your info !!!"
1,App is not proper functioning well . Last seen and profile photo is not shown of some contact .please solve the problem.
1,since latest update its been horribly slow and doesn't let me receive new messages. I deleted cache and reinstalled but no use. made it 100 times worse
3,"It's still bugging, and there's now channels and I don't need them! Too much social update going on in this private texting service!"
1,"Since over 3 months , Forwarding a message is taking too much time, I don't why,, the processor is also capable but only in Whatsapp laging issue and Forwarding a message is taking too much time. Resolve this issue, üòë"
5,"Today I had just a little experience by installing this app. Last time I was so confused about the denial of my phone number. The only thing I didn't like, is that, somehow in my phone conversation, I was interrupted. Please don't do that to people, for many of us are complaining. Beside this issue, I myself love the app. Thanks again for allowing us to be closer to our family and friends in the whole world. God bless you more and more. You will be always the head of all the medias."
1,"Immediately I updated my Whatsapp the rest is history, since last week I don't have access to my Whatsapp again keep telling to reinstall again üò° after have installed and uninstall like 8 times,"
1,"What's this thing that I've been unable to use WhatsApp on my phone every now and there, just been logging me out every time, and after sometimes I'll be able to register it again, I even use another number to register it, but still the same. Over 2 months now I've been having this challenges and I don't even know what to do,, I've tried all the WhatsApp I know, yet it doesn't work."
1,"Nowadays, the wtsapp is not user-friendly. To open itself, it will take a lot of time, even though after opening the wtsapp, the mgs will not get loaded. If I check later some time, I can see the mgs from prior time beforehand, which I checked. Even photos are not getting shared over the wtsapp . I can see the photos, but after clicking on the send button, it's not sending. Also, I did a uninstall and reinstalled it, but still, the issue is persisting. Please get this resolved ASAP."
5,This app seems to work better than regular texts or cell calls. It certainly does in most rural Utah areas.
1,I am not able to login to my whatsApp account as it gives message that 'you need offcial whatsapp to use this account.' I uninstall app and again installed from whatapp site. But it gave same error message. When i contacted whatapp customer care they responded it is outside scope of whatsapp. Very poor response.
4,Whatsapp is now making good development in usee interface and privacy. For additional features whatsapp should look into expanding sharing file size for document and video.
1,"This feature is not good. We used to feel that WhatsApp is our personal life. But I did not like watching their channels, please remove this feature."
1,Worse after update.. everytime press emogi icon whole page just goes up and need to repressed again to pull all down again.. it not very convenient.. already email support team but they just say this is from Android keyboard.. never happened b4 update.. so.. I have not resolve this
4,I love whatsapp because it is very efficient and reliable way of communication.I think you have a need to add some new features in WhatsApp like it show that how many time we have spend on WhatsApp on first page and it show how many time we have spend on personal chat and in groups.I think chat lock feature is best but it is on top therefore any one can see that we have a personal chat with anyone.
1,App is too overwhelming. Features should remain at the top bar for easy access. Features at the bottom is eye sore. Thanks
1,"We want an important Where is privacy in WhatsApp? I am getting so many messages from unknown numbers, how should I completely stop getting messages from unknown numbers. Just like we have 'Dont allow message requests ' in Instagram. We need a feature to complete stop getting messages from unknown people"
1,"The update version of chanell is irritating, so undo it !!!! Don't copy anyone ok? Be unique, so remove the channel options form what's app"
1,"The apps getting worse, please solve the video call function. The picture presented unclear while internet connection is strong signal with 5G."
5,The only bad thing about this app is the apps inability to help retrieve stolen accounts in time. My personal experience today was that my account was hacked but I have to wait for six days before I can retrieve because the hacker two way email security code.
4,Its humble request to what's aap team to make a system that when we post long video on the status it will be automatically posted without any cutting and increase the time duration of video in the status .....
5,"I would like it to be possible to change the coloe of the chat per person, fo example, if I put a pin on an importaant chat it could be a different color"
5,"The app should allow for merging of groups like FB. Since the group capacity has been enlarged, all splinters of group created when it was 256 persons per group should be allowed to merge into just one. I hope this recommendation is out into perspective."
4,The Edit button should be somewhere out instead of inside three dots optn. One of the most convenient app ever developed for communication. Day by day its getting better :)
1,"Should definitely implement the scheduling message option. Because now if you want to schedule messages on WhatsApp, you have to install a third party application. As a result messages have no privacy as third party applications are being used."
1,"When i want to reply to a message and i lwft swipe, my keyboard doesn't open, and its very annoying when i talk with multipple people at the same time and i have to reply to message fast and open the keyboard. And with the new update, when changing between emojis and keyboard, it jumps, and its really annoying, pls fix that."
2,"I spent 3 hours trying to transfer WhatsApp from my old phone to a new phone, and it still doesn't work. Signal worked first time. I remember a similar problem last time I needed a new phone, but I can't believe it's still not fixed!! Also, why can't I share audio mp4 files with whatsapp? Apart from that, whatsapp is a functionally excellent app, but I have concerns about privacy implications and would advise anybody to consider Signal as an alternative."
3,"Before the last update you could type a message and then attach a photo for example....the text would be delivered with the photo. Now you type the text, add the photo, send the photo but the text isn't sent and disappears. Yes you can add a photo and send a caption which seems to be delivered together. I couldn't see this new feature in your change list......or am I missing something???"
1,"I absolutely hate the new emoji layout. Why do you feel the need to change the layout that everyone is so familiar with? Major categories, eg emoji, gif and stickers should be at the bottom and the minor categories such as emoji category options should be at the top. New update sucks, i struggle trying to use emojis everytime because the buttons have moved"
2,"Slow forwarding message The new update to WhatsApp has made it much slower to forward messages to groups. This is because the app now displays the number of members in each group when you forward a message to it. This information is not necessary, and it actually slows down the forwarding process. I urge WhatsApp to remove this unnecessary feature and make it faster to forward messages to groups."
4,"Why cant u guys fix the notification issue, include this in apps setting only. I believe we can expect this much from u guys as u r the biggest company in the world of communication."
1,It's been very bad from last few months they blocked my no without any reason.. And having no any other customer care on which we can directly contact
1,"The new update is totally absurd. Leave this app for friends, family, and relatives . We don't want to see public figures on whatsapp. Please remove this update ASAP. Otherwise, we'll move to other platforms"
1,"""Disappointed with the latest WhatsApp update. The changes made are not user-friendly and have disrupted the experience. Please revert to the previous version.""Feel free to customize this review further to better reflect your thoughts and feelings about the update."
3,Hi Whatsapp and Team Whatsapp It is a highly recommend suggestion by people and me make your privacy policy strict so that no one is allowed to do screen recording while using WhatsApp. You must definitely think on it and put it on high priority . Thank you WhatsApp and WhatsApp team
1,This new update is useless....... explain to me why the search option in the status section has been deleted.... Don't we have any other work except scrolling WhatsApp ..It is becoming more time consuming
1,This new upgrade is horrible please please revert to past or take away the banner at the bottom. It's really horrible.
4,üá≥‚Ääüá¥‚Ääüáπ‚Ääüá™‚Ää sometimes status video sopport. Yes my one video 60second. Im one time setting 30second and next some video next 30second not fixed.. Every time üá™‚Ääüá∑‚Ääüá∑‚Ääüá¥‚Ääüá∑‚Ää..????
3,The fact that the pictures suck and you can't save a text as a draft or schedule a send out time is dumb. WhatsApp needs to be upgraded. We're in 2023! Come on UX designers!!!!
5,"This app is a very simple and fast to contact of any other people like parents , relatives ,friends etc and also sharing files very easy"
2,"Read & thumbs up. 1. 'Mark as unread from here' option in chats. 2. Option to notify people that you've marked it for later. 3. Option to sort statuses by oldest, so that we can watch them all before it expires. 4. Automatic status change isn't needed, except for videos, gifs & other moving pictures, we'll change it by touch. 5. Vacation mode needed. 6. Scheduling messages. 7. Dark theme could've been pure black, not dark grey."
5,"Very good messanger , dear all whatsapp community I want to say that pliz in future we all need a more update features like we can enjoy a music easily on a whatsapp status, kindly update that feature as soon as possible, thank you....."
1,"Chat transfer fail lost all data. New chat transfer is a pain in***. When app is closed during backup chats are lost in both phones, my local backup also not visible unlike older versions, all chats ages old is lost in seconds. Became *** like facebook."
5,It is nice using this app but when you need an update that it won't work It should rather work as it was so that when you have an important message you can still see it and when you want to update it you may update ~Zaahiyah~‚ô•
1,I did uip payment from this on 5th Sep the amount not credited in the receiver account and not yet credited back to my account. I raised so many disputes but no use. Please clear the issue
3,"Screen goes blank when playing voice messages, my phone screen goes completely black, I can still hear the voice but it's too soft to hear, after trying to listen to a voice message about 5 or 6 times it eventually works if i skip forward a little then push play. Not great because i like to use voice messages a lot and this has become very frustrating.. To the point that i may uninstall very soon if morning changes"
1,BAD!!!! It takes restarting the app to refresh call log. I update 30secs status and it still only show part. How many seconds am I supposed to update againüòì
1,A very bad experience to use this wrost application. This wrost application ban my aacount without any reason and remove my ban when I sent e mail and ban account in every 24 hours I sent email to what's app help centre more than 50 time but nothing works
4,"I'm frustrated. I can't able to register or received verification code. It's three weeks now. No communication, I've tried many times to open my whatsapp app or login. All I can see number not verified or you need the official WhatsApp to use this account. I'm still using the official whatsapp to open my whatsapp ,they are still telling me number not verified or you the official whatsapp to open my account. I'm really stressed, please I need help."
4,"Improvement are amazing üòç but need to choose everything,everytime send or share. Still one of the best."
2,"The latest update is literally unnecessary!!, it's confusing and not easy to use the keyboard and the emojis due to moving the selection bar to the top plus i thought the emojies delete button disappeared that's how confusing the changes are!, and the typing bar doesn't appear when i use the emojis and i can't send the massage without scrolling down the keyboard, it's not fast and practical as it used to be."
1,"I don't what is happening this is around 20th time I am reinstalling my WhatsApp. After Every 2-3 days it crashes. I have changed my phone twice, but this issue sustains. And it really, difficult to reinstall the app and restore the backup again and again. If there is a bug please fix it or revert me as soon as possible."
2,"Poor .changes itself fm one to another aspect. Without connecting, mob gets connected. After switch off it opens very very slowly.reboot/reset is extremely slow. Recharging is extremely slow but reverse is fast. Why every second ""ur memory is full "" is splaced on the screen. Imediately clean otherwisr the mob is-----bla bla every time."
2,"The app does what it's supposed to do, but for the last week I notice that whenever I provide mic access to it to send a voice note the app keeps using the microphone even when I close it. This is completely unnecessary and I don't like the idea of this happening. Please revert it to how it was before and explain why you are doing this."
1,This App is not working. It keeps asking to delete other Apps on your phone to make space. I deleted quite a few of my useful Apps then realized I did not need to.Because:Then when that is done and there is space then it says the same thing all over again and sometimes it says it cannot dowload to phone and advises to check troubleshooting section. This App is full of pure problems and quite a few people that I know are having the same problem with downloading this new version of WhatsApp.üëéüò°üò°
2,Design means data eventually takes up too much space on phone and it's not easy for users to manage. Removing media removes the accompanying text with the message too. Really only useful for conversations that you can afford to lose/wipe.
3,"Bad UI at sticker section , send button and erase button to close , time waste while searching, older version is much better"
3,This app is very good but i want to give a suggestion. We can go live in instagram and facebook. So whatsapp should be updated to that extent we can go live vidoes in whats up also.....
3,The simplest of features such built in translator and being logged in to more than one device at a time are missing. Not sure why it's taking so long to implement that.
3,Why the app always hangs when I try to update my profile photo? Being a mobile developer i believe there is no hurdle for image processing üòÄ do you have any extra thing running in background for using image üßê Please fix it..
3,"I'm unhappy that some major visual changes have been made. Especially the new emoticon layout and how it updates recently used live, that movement is very annoying."
3,"Very nice and useful app but my only complain is with the new update, the old community grps which l had left, there were some important msg in that, now it is not showing it, and we again and again have to tap in grps and then announcements and all, the old version was better, plz try to make that changes again, rest all is nice..."
1,"My whatsapp number is blocked, I don't know, whatsapp showing ""use official app"" but actually I'm using official app only, I'm trying multiple times to reinstall from play Store, but it's not working"
5,"It's a nice app, but if I could add a new feature. I would add filters when you are video calling someone so that you just don't look like a ghost üëª"
1,"For some reason it won't register my phone no sayings it's because I'm not using the correct app. Then it gives me the link to the ""correct"" app which is back here. Can someone help me. Update I have reset my phone it didnt work Pls send help"
4,"Actually I Found Some Issue With WhatsApp App User Data When I Took A Video Of High Quality That's Size Is More Than 1 GB Or More & Put A Small Part ""30Sec"" Of It On My WhatsApp Status, After That My WhatsApp App User Data Increase By The Size Of Video Size & Then Problem Is I Am Not Able To Clear It From Manage Storage Data Inside WhatsApp Settings & By Delete WhatsApp Folder From My Internel Storage."
5,I like this app a lot but one day suddenly I got stucked bcs whatsapp is not opening √†nd showing close app repeatedly then I uninstalled then I installed again still not working properly so updated version also like this...
1,"The new channel update is very pathetic and frustrating to use, this is not required please provide an option to completely remove to channel."
1,"This is the worst update, because it does not have status search option, so bad update. I am very annoyed because of this update, please stop this Enter search option in update option"
1,I don't want to see channels in updates tab. I need an option to turn it off. Not user friendly.
1,I have been facing lit many issues while doing audio or video call on what's up its really badd and pls tell how to get the previous version only .
1,"I have a problem with the messages, they take a long time to be sent, It's not the internet as such, nor the phone. This error has been happening to me for the last few days"
3,There us problem with new update of this app. When I reply to specific message by pulling it right; I don't get enough space to look at emoji keyboard. Barely one row is visible. WhatsApp Needs to solve this problem.
1,"I hate it. garbage app. I DONT WANT TO SHARE MY INTETEST WITH THIS COMPANY. HOW ABOUT A BASIC APP THAT DOES NOTHING BUT SIMPLY MESSAGE. NO? OF COURSE NOT, TOO MUCH INFORMATION HAVESTING TO JUST HAVE A MERE 1% OF DECENCY AND REAPECT FOR.OTHERS."
4,"Now wattsapp is really good. But I want to request to add this feature i.e, allow us to make polls on our status . It will really become helpful. Plz consider it team ."
5,"This is best social media. It keeps privacy, doesn't gossip on its own. Afterall everyone needs some privacy, restrict news to few.."
1,"The app was working fine on my phone, till I made an update, then suddenly, the app gets all buggy. When I open the app whiles connected to the WiFi or cellular: 1. the app takes a couple of seconds to 'load' before I can even use it. 2. Images on ""status"" take a LONG TIME to load. I can't watch any videos on ""status"" because, videos get VERY laggy (audio from video flows smoothly, but video frames do not) 3. Becomes unresponsive FREQUENTLY."
3,"When I call someone, it automatically disconnects, the video quality is poor, and sometimes it doesn't connect to the other person. Additionally, I often get stuck in the middle of the call."
1,Everything is good but the reason i give one star is because when i want to change my dp It irritates me. You can not select the portion of the image on your own. When i want to lower one side of the image it minimizes from all side i hate this thing. Please improve it and then i wiil change my rating.
1,Are they actively trying to make the app worse? From bad UI changes to constant unbearable bugs. Each update makes this app worse and I can't make sense of it
1,"My whatsapp is not working from.last 2-3 days ,its showing messge that after review it has closed ,.i am using it for office work, and facing big problem because if this, pls resolve it ASAP, its showing messge that we completes review and found this accouny activity goes against terms and service of whatsap. I dont know why this showing as i am using it for my office work and it is containing geunine and important data, pls solve this issue fast"
3,This is a great app. But there's a slight problem as I don't have the fingerprint feature in my mobile I can't lock chat as far as I've read the guidelines it's only available or applicable to those who have fingerprint lock in their mobile. It would be better if you develop it in such a way where people using phone without fingerprint lock feature can use it too. Nonetheless is easiest way for communication. @support
3,"everything is fine but the app has been crashing while receiving video calls lately, and remove those celebrity channels."
2,"My number was barred by mistake due to misconception, and it was unbarred later on. But now I can't verify my number to log in, as I have unsaved files in my chat"
3,"WhatsApp not having a cloud storage where you'll meet your messages and media anytime you login on another device is very bad and secondly, WhatsApp should update and allow us login to different devices at a time."
1,The latest update with regards to emojis is so bad. The older version was much better when choosing an emoji or gif or sticker.
3,"Dear Whatsapp, I wish to have easier access to emoticon like it used to be and I also wish to have the delete status simultaneously button once again...apart from that everything is okay"
2,Every update just gets worse. Not happy about the fact that the new update took away the option to mute group chat notifications and still see the notifications. It was a useful option as I don't want instant notifications from all groups but I would like to know if there is a message in the group. Now I don't see anything until I open the app. Which is frustrating because I don't want my phone buzzing all the time but I also don't want to keep opening the app just to see if there are messages.
3,"During what's app calls, if I am putting my phone on speaker then the person on the other end of the call will hear an echo of themselves, when they will speak"
1,Remove payment options in typing body. place it on other top corner location. Total contact count doesn't appear. Status search option deleted after installing the new update .
3,This was best and simple app for connecting but now its becoming complicated and useless features are coming don't make it insta or fb let WhatsApp be like old one this channel features is so irritating
5,"Love the app. However, why is it that when I swipe text to reply the keyboard no longer automatically pull up. I have to hit the type message space to bring up the keyboard."
1,Give back the old emoji tray. The new one is a different sized (larger) screen and getting back to typing after an emoji is really annoying now. The back button closes the type window and when you open it again it still is in the emoji tray. Super annoying update üòí I only use the Google suggested emoji now
2,"1. Work on the backing up messages. Now it takes longer time and you have to wait for a long time before the backing up messages will be completed. It is very irritating 2. I don't see the sense in forcing people to watch status when we have no intention. Why should I click to see a friend's DP and instead I am taking straight to the friend's status to watch. This is deceit and waste of precious bundle. If i want to see status I know where to go, stop wasting our datas."
2,"Please attention üôè ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è There is no feature for copying text meassage directly in personal chat, 1st you should go to select text meassage then click on 3 dots,,,,then Copy, It's too difficult! Plz give us the copying option directly near to 3 dots."
3,"Hello, any issues reported with this update? My Samsung s21+ is doing a weird screen glitch when I try to use emojis. It shoots the conversation to the top of the page and leaves half of the screen blank!"
1,New Channel features is not suitable for every user of wp it must have hide option you can not force your user to use it and compulsory display it on status bar screen
1,"Channels is horrible! Stop making this into another social media app, just let it be the good messaging app it was and is meant to be!"
1,I don't get my varification code nor get varification call when I click call me than its give I hour time this happened again and again I am also complain many time but problem not solve that's why I am not able to use my WhatsApp ... Bad response
1,"New update to the UI with the stickers and emoji is absolutely awful. The changes are for what exactly? Not only that, the new UI is absolutely buggy with typing/emoji and sticker"
1,"Very poor performance by whatsapp now a day's,because after good signal strength,video or voice call is not connecting."
4,Very good but one issue is that Last seen have privacy. It must not have any privacy aption. Last seen should stay active for everyone
1,This latest update has everything confusing! I like the old one where you just have chats status and call logs this new channel they added it made the app worst
3,The watch app has destroyed WhatsApp notifications on my watch. I no longer receive notifications on my watch and i am seriously considering deleting the app from my watch.
1,"Idk what you guys did since taking over but this app is plagued with issues. Why do you guys at facebook try your best to ruin eveything. I can't register my number because the app, which i downloaded from the play store tells me its not the original WhatsApp. I have not used any 3rd party WA and this phone was recently wiped. I have a very good feeling its because its not a modern phone as companies like this are trying to force ppl to upgrade and restrict them from using 3rd party apps. Fk u"
1,Chat lock feature is good but it should only open with fingerprint Not should be open by password. Because generally our passwords our relatives know and they can easily read our private chat. So I apply to remove chat unlock system by password. It should be only opened by fingerprint.
2,"Passing from one phone to another is stupidly antiquated and inpractical. It requires you to reinstall the app or it will not recognize your Drive back-ups, even though they are the only ones in the back-up folder... And if by a strike of bad luck one happens to click back-up in the new phone before restoring the previous file, the latter will be unrecoverably overwritten by the new one..."
2,"very frustrating to send screenshots , despite has + does not send 2 picture together (only i get a group of photos from other people in one message) but if i add, then only send second. it does not do what it is supposed to do even after updating version. also the options are too scattered and the interface for attach does not open gallery of photos but showed artificial albums. i wish i did not need to use it."
1,I can't register my number with this app anytime I try it ask me to download the latest version I have done that but still asking me to do so. Can't even receive code to activa. for the app to send the code through SMS it send through my email account. Any help. Can't use any type of whatsapp
1,"Latest update is the worst. Don't install, you will be bothered with channels instead only seeing your stories. Do not update!"
1,"When I am entering message while adding a WhatsApp Status, the message is being posted as a seperate status inspite of merging with the one I have added."
4,The feature of locked chat is good but it is not good that the media of the contact with locked chat will not be visible in the mobile gallery. It should only depend on the user what he/she wants
1,My account gets banned almost everytime and it's always for the same reason whenever I try to add someone to a group it bans me and says it's spam I'm really confused and annoyed cause the same thing just happened I had to get a new number because of this
3,"The new ""Updates"" page is frustrating. Please add a feature to disable the ""Channels"" feature."
1,"Not Simple Not reliable Privacy --->don't know what to say The user interface is going downwards day by day...WhatsApp is no more simple nor is it easy, Adding features is a good sign but not those features which doesn't pertain to what the main intention is... Currently reviewing about the *emoji keyboard* where emoji comes after some time, where transition isn't smooth as well as takes lot of time Not to review about the ads we getüôè Pls leave the customers alone, they are really disturbing"
1,Worst customer service. I'm trying to register but no method is working not callnor sms. Mail this problem to whatsApp team two times. But zero solutions provided by whatsApp.
1,"My WhatsApp keeps saying can't send the code and I have to wait an other hour each time, iv been trying for 2 days now. . . I reset my phone back to new and now I can't load WhatsApp. My number is right Im connected to WiFi and have unlimited data. What is going on or what am I doing wrong??!"
3,I find I can rely on WhatsApp four messages photos and chatting. I switched from messages or messaging to WhatsApp because it was easier to get pictures and chat and I am satisfied with WhatsApp I rarely use the other apps that I have for conversing
1,Im not able to login to my WhatsApp account suddenly n when i complain they don't respond properly or not even try to reach out totally disappointed n frustrated at the same time I'm trying from past 20 days to login to WhatsApp . No matter how Many times I've sent email n complaint but they're least bothered to look into the problem n fix it
5,Very efficient way of communicating with even elderly they can just record and send a voice note.
4,"Kindly review the mode of sending messages. From the latest update, message (voice notes and image) do not automatically send after network interruption has been restored. You always have to now go back and click on retry before it could be sent. WhatsApp is indeed the best messaging App. Be sure to do something, Thanks."
1,"No help at all. Had an issue where my voice messages wouldnt send and overall the app was working horribly, asked the support team for help or methods to fix, got absolutely no help and was given silly solutions such as turn the phone on and off or turn wifi on and off which did nothing. They then proceeded to tell me the problem was resolved and that they were closing thr issue. Thanks for the great help WhatsApp üëç"
2,My what's app has big problem.it keeps stopping.I have this issue for 3 weeks now. I reinstalled it twice and I even changed my number but still has problem fix it please.
1,Very much disappointed by the newer version of what's app.... anybody unknowingly can link my WhatsApp to his handset ...this happened to me and my privacy was disturbed.... what's app should make two factor authentication enable while linking to another smartphone.... otherwise it can create havoc related to privacy.... Strict action should be taken as soon as possible.
3,Can you PLEEEEEAAAASE not clear my chat notifocations unless I open that specific chat. I should be able to open the app or one chat without you clearing every single notification I have.
1,This new update in the status bar is very disgusting as it's creating a problem to use the whatsapp for my parents.. please remove that add channel option that is been updated in the Status bar.. please humble request
4,I feel like there should be a highlight option in a group chat. That'd help a lot to point out important messages.
5,"In your new update. Right below new message button which having no use. In both the cases we have to search the contact by clicking search tab. So, why we have open by two clicks."
1,"Bought a phone, and downloaded a new whatsapp and guess what! I'm unable to get a successful registration on my device, it keeps on saying, I need an official whatsapp account for this account. I'm really depressed by this response I don't know what to do because this is my main contact I use, almost everyone knows me by this number"
1,"Can't play the voice note, all functions are working excluding the play button. I'm using the latest version of whatsaap"
1,"Archive feature earlier was better, which was shown In the top and new messages in archive was not coming outside the archive path."
1,"Even though I given the camara permission as ask every time, when I try to open the camera on WhatsApp it gives two options ""not now"" or ""change the setting "". I hate WhatsApp now. Why it need to have the microphone and camara permission as always. One of these days I will leave WhatsApp for ever."
1,WhatsApp become Instagram Hell there has been they put channels name in update.. I don't want to join any channels because of this things my status and muted status are being displaced from status What the hack WhatsApp?!!!
2,"I really hates the new upadate, i'm talking about the channel thingy..like whatsapp are meant for me to chat and update about my families and friends and I don't care about nothing else..if I want to know about those things I already have FB to keep me up to date! You guys need to get rid of those thing or at least allow us...user to hid it from the update feed to make it look like it used to.."
1,It is full of bugs after updates. Please fix it specially when using emoji's.kindly request to fix it immediately.
2,"Unwanted ""features"" being added to copy other messengers cum broadcast apps. Whatsapp must understand people are using this app instead of those apps for a reason."
5,"Whatsapp is the best actually ,I have been using it since the first term I bought my phone almost 7 years and I have never encountered any issue apart from yesterday that I made mistake and they ban my account ,I'm waiting up till now they didn't unban it ,the reason was there is our community that admin create and I see option add your group I thought everyone can add his group members there and I clicked on it ,I tap on add participants I mistakely add some people that are not in my contacts"
2,"When I first started using the app, it was good, it worked, it downloaded rhe videos and photos, but as of the last 2 months, it's been lagging both in the app itself and when tou receive notifications, it also will not download videos and its slow downloading or sending photos, and I use this app and have to send photos and video for my work as I work at a school and need proof when the kids damage property. This needs to be fixed!!"
5,"*The only thing that remain for WhatsApp to add to their features is the ability to be seeing deleted messages and statuses, and again the ability to share voice notes made by others on our statuses without screen recording them! üòåüåùüòÑüòÑüòÇ I hope they'll add them very soon üòåüåù. Yes! And also, different color background and text colors for status posts, with more fonts."
5,WhatsApp is really a good and convenient app. But one of its shortcomings is that it doesn't know whether the members are online or not. Now I want a system like imo messenger to know whether the members are online or not.
1,I did not got the update for channels in whatsapp iam using samsung galaxy A33. When i will get update..in whatsp for that..and my phone software is up to date.
2,There is too many updates coming for this otherwise great app. Plus I've been having an issue with my downloaded audio messages. They automatically delete after about 14 days. Some of them are things that I would like to listen to repetitively. I actually prefer the older versions of WhatsApp for this reason.
1,The badest service they given me and not giving proper response also i have emailed them four times and they keep on sending default system mail which does not concern with my issue
4,"Hey this is a great app overall yeah, but it's been quite interesting lately, as I've been having some glitches with status how that sounds from a previous status keeps playing even when it's past it already and the worst happened today, it didn't stop even when I closed the app. Before I had this experience I've heard couple of my close folks talk about this same issue. Please fix this!!!"
1,Please fix this update. It's just keep getting uglier. Pressing back option taking us out of the chat ...it's annoying.
1,The update that added channel is annoying. I hate the channel part because it's making the app more like Facebook . I completely hate the update
4,Hello its unbelievable peoples are using this all over the world but one thing i want to add for the next update is that we should be able to mention with @sign our friends in status so they can understand our feelings...
1,WhatsApp's new update status is absolutely useless. There is no search button in the status. Updates are written above. Put it back as it was before
2,"It's ok but why I'm I not seeing the updates on my WhatsApp even though I have already updated it. And also, it would be better if you allow us have the options of tagging people on our statuses."
3,The one really annoying thing about this is that the send button is on the bottom right hand side instead of the return button! The amount of times I accidentally press that button before I've finished a message is annoying and happens on a daily basis. And not ideal that you can start another sentence on another line as there is no rerun button that I can find ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2,I think watsapp should create extra space for channels and Status not the update And the status now becomes complex to view especially for people that have a lot of contact status to view
1,"what's with the new update? Let this only app be sober. no need to copy fb, insta and twitter. user interface is becoming unfriendly. loser update"
5,"is whatsapp very exilent aap. I have officially medical student and Very important msg and any work so patient report, feedback and class work,very hard work. Most popular aap very nice"
1,"Nowadays, whatsapp is going worst day by day, I don.t how, sometime thing are not visibling in gallery, and sometime it is noy working well, It is better to use other site then this whatsapp."
1,connecting issue in whatsapp one specific contact unable to make video calls on whatsapp.. it's continuously show reconnecting.. but we both are in good network area
1,Not Good... New version of this app is not good.....The New what's app Status setting is Poor. I didn't like it at all. Old Version was Osum. I wanted to Give - 5 (Minus Five) Stars... But options were not available...
1,Very disappointed with the channels. The news isn't loading after the update of new feature in the whatsapp.
5,"Suggestions: 1. Implement an unread message feature that displays unread messages at the top of the chat window. Once a message is read, it should move below the unread messages.2. Include a feature that allows users to share multiple documents or photos in a single message. This will enhance the convenience and efficiency of sharing files.3. Introduce separate tabs for group messages and personal messages. This will help users to easily navigate between different types of conversations."
2,WhatsApp is really good and it has help in alot of ways by helping to interact with people that are across the country easily
1,This is the worst update i ever seen ! In this new update we can follow up the channels which is totally useless.
1,"What is this useless new feature in the status menu, if I want update and news I would go to twitter, maybe Facebook. Don't ruin this to. Let it just be a chat app."
4,"Everything is fine,,and great updation day to day, but status blure problem is very bad. I hope your team working immediately on this problem."
4,Please help me out when I want to screen record during video call it always tells me that it's can't go because my mic is in use .
1,"Took me years to accept using this thing because I really disliked the contacts management policy. I eventually installed it and despite WhatsApp promise, contacts upload is NOT optional. There's no setting to disable contacts upload, only an Android setting to disable contacts sync, which the app switches back on without notice. Another thing which is still unchanged is the inability to use an SD card as the default storage. For an app that stores everything local, this really drives me mad!"
1,"Please, work on the emoji section fast. This is two months, and nothing has been done. I'm beginning to dislike the app."
2,What bug is creating now a days by WhatsApp. My WhatsApp has got hacked by someone.. 1st it's happened with me now it also creating problems with my wife WhatsApp. Someone is using my WhatsApp. I can't use my WhatsApp and the profile photo had changed by someone pic and it's showing that I am online... Please resolve this problem quickly..
1,"I've too much satisfied with WhatsApp but new update which add channel feature in status bar i think this is most disgusting update like any there messenger app like Instagram,FB now you'll get distracted with useless channel i thing WhatsApp is only useful app rather than time wasting app I request please META please remove your this useless update otherwise I'll have to go somewhere else"
2,I'm not sure when this started happening but the microphone access is constantly on all the time. I have the notification on as if it's actively using the microphone when when the app is not open or a call is being made. This seems like a security issue. The app is having the microphone on all the time without the app being used.
5,"Have been loving the wear os version of whatsapp. It's very handy. One thing to request, kindly provide us with atleast 5 pinned chats option."
1,"Please do not make this whatapp into tiktok or Snapchat alike or even bombard with force advertisement. I need basic whatapp chat to people I have in contact with. I really want to remove ""channels"" from my whatapp. Please give me this options that I can decide to if I want to keep it or remove it."
3,"4k videos are compressed in an awful quality. Of course compression is necessary, but the quality is way too bad. HDR video cannot be sent without the colour being changed drastically. GoogleDrive backup hangs at 99% and won't complete. Data security & privacy :-( This is the reason why I moved to signal wherever I can."
3,"It let's you edit you sent message but it other person already replied, you cannot edit previous message. Better if you could"
3,"Why does everytime i use camera through this app, my phone starts freezing? I thought it was my phone but when i use other apps, the camera seems to be normal. Please fix this."
1,I'm unable to post on my WhatsApp status and I'm not able to view people's status either keeps writing file doesn't exist on device And texts are working fine
3,"This is the second time in one year I am trying to update the app and it's refusing. The first time I lost all my data after I decided to uninstall and install it again, now it's refusing to update again. Could you please, improve on this aspect, because it leaves one weary and angry. Apart from this the app is a great app"
3,Hii may i know were the muted status will be seen üòê in the last update . And also search icon was not present in the status screen
5,"Very good But in these two days, I have been battling about my account, it's always banned, I will write review, send mails but still it will opened for less than 24hrs and still be restricted."
3,Would be nice if we could post HD quality videos on our statuses everytime i try to post one it comes out blurry i swear WhatsApp cant handle the quality its 2023 and we cant even post 1080p or 4k vids on our statuses please fix this
5,WhatsApp your current reviews is very good. But can you create a new tab for the channels. So to separate it from the status for android users like me.
2,"I've had this app for 8yrs and it's always been my favourite messaging app, but the last 6 months or so it's been so unreliable, notification sound is on yet messages come through silent I've missed so many important messages because it didn't make a noise. takes hours to deliver messages abroad when it never used to. When I'm in the middle of a conversation it tells me I may have new messages which then take forever to actually come through. Video call and phone call quality is atrocious fix it"
1,This app sucks alot like it's a glitch everytime... I can't even send a photo or a video to someone to can upload a status. My network was really fine and fast and then this app is such a glitch I have to reinstall nd Uninstall it often just because of it. You guys have to fix this problem immediately it didn't happen for once or twice it happened many times. Because of that I changed my mobile and now it's not even working properly. Fix it as soon as possible. Thank you
1,My account is blocked since last 15 day with out any valid reason. Worst thing I felt about this app. Now moving to some other platform.
3,Whatsapp is my GoTo messenger app but I am Really Fruustrated with this new emoji board!Everytime i use emojis and send the message I can't see the message I sent without scrolling up. It never did that. Please change it back to the old one or something better but this new one is just not working outüòê
5,It is so fustrating... I have been installing dis app for a hour now wat de heck is going on...i need em for something very important... You cant even install the one another person sends to youüò°. There is actually an improvement nowüòâ
1,"PLEASE UPDATE YOUR APPS!!! DOUBLE CLICK TO BACK FROK ANY CHATS?üòÜ WHATS JOKES YOU HAVE MADE? HARD FOR EVERY REPLIES, BECAUSE ALL TIME NO SHOW FOR KEYBOARD. NEED TO FORCE LEFT FROM WHATSAPP,THEN COME AGAIN FOR REPLY. WTH? 1 S T A R O N L Y !!!!!!!!"
5,I'm using the whatsApp last 7-8 years yet now I don't have prblm with it The app us working so nicely and easy. Share with someone which is important you can oh whatsApp it will be safe and fully Secure it.
1,New Channels feature have ruined the status tab. Remove it from Status tab and add it as a separate tab. We don't even need it
5,"Best option to chat! I LOVE IT! It's been 10 years since I use it and always you do something that I really love! Right now, I'm in love of the video notes üòçüòçüòç"
1,"Status quality is getting low when it's being uploaded. Fix this problem soon. After the recent updates, these issue has come. Do fix this issueü§¨."
1,I recently updated my WhatsApp I saw when I'm trying to send imogi and then after sending it look like where it's gone... Simply means the new updates are just disgusting please WhatsApp change it ..
5,Your latest updates which can see our channels is very excellent I just updated it now but it is not happening to this phone but on other phone it happens fastly.
1,"I hate updates layout/feature! Don't try to be like other social media apps, be original. Please status is just enough."
3,"Old fashioned inconvenient messenger. However it is the same as Facebook. It is not possible to write to a person until adding to your contact list. It is not possible to send a big file. No stickers, emojis are redrawed for no reason. I hope once developers will realize that it is 2023 already ""Couldn't complete backup"" notification couldn't be closed and it uses your google disk. Reptiloids have to do perfect apps as a more perfect stage of evolution."
3,"With the recent update which is cool, My muted status updates have completely disappeared and I can't see them anywhere."
1,"I will give it 1. Whenever i restart my phone,it uninstalls,never backups messages i end up loosing work nessages. Its a disaster."
1,"The rate at which you are banning numbers from WhatsApp is getting annoying. One will email your support team to rectify the problem but never gets a response back. Even when one hasn't gone against any standards. Again, After marking several documents to send to a particular person it only sends one, meaning you have send each of the document one after the other."
1,Im not happy latest feature added: channels getting inappropriate content ..how can i filter it out. It is listing all the waste in the world
1,Chat Jumping. Any chat i go in if i try to scroll up just a bit the app takes it as me trying to dig up old messages and sends me back way above what i was trying to look for. Sometimes a day before or more. Ive talked to a few people and they experience this too. Also need a feature to download multiple attachments at once. Its annoying to have to download individual attachments
3,Does the job. Bit frustrating that when you want to read messages you sometimes need to update before being allowed to respond.
1,Facebook is ruining this app and it's interface day by day...the previous versions were better...This version is no longer like that classic whatsapp that we head known
1,"Why this nonsense additional features like channel you added in WhatsApp, kindly remove this what's app is now commonly use for work and connectivity to make easiness for life on daily basis kindly do not make it Rush full app."
5,A very important app for easy recepient of messages and lot more. I'm really enjoying it. Keep it up.
1,I've been using WhatsApp for years now. However the latest update doesn't allow me to send/share multiple documents at a time. I've selected several files but only one file is being sent. hope the team could do something about this. It has caused inconvenience to me and perhaps to many other users too.
2,"I don't like the fact that deleted messages, view once messages etc can be seen by people who use gb Whatsapp, fm WhatsApp etc. What happened to keeping peoples privacy private. It should be worked on asap"
1,New update is like social messages getting involved. It's should be for message and it should show messages. It's becoming social network platform. Not liking it
3,Channel updates in WhatsApp.....no need at all because it will distract the user...but there is only WhatsApp in which I feel no disturbance bcoz it connects only to our contact no useless media. Please make option to delete channel updateüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª.........plzz take some actions(WhatsApp is my favourite social media app bcoz in WhatsApp there is no disturbance.)....Three star is bcoz plzz changes channel update..... otherwise five Star ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
1,Video status time decreased from 30 sec to 15 sec. it's really a bad step. want the previous version
1,"This isn't a 1 start rating, it's just to draw your attention to my suggestion. You guys are awesome but please create the option to pin messages. üëç"
4,There is problem in apk .when we attend call the phone screen turn off .It create a problem for users.Over all application is good.
3,"Okay. In the latest update, we couldn't reach the sticker pack we want easily. Like we gotta scroll through the whole section üï≥Ô∏èü§∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1,"I can't send stickers and emoji because the menu won't open, even when it did it just show a blank page."
3,Need a feature to block scam call or video calls in whatap. Some feature to block unknown callers. Focus on security features than unwanted features
5,You guys are doing a great job. There are lots of great updates. The video voices message is my best. No one is able to share with another person.
5,"Firstly I would like to thank Team whatsapp for accepting my humble request instead of there busy schedules, thank you sooooo much Team Whatsapp, so nice of Team Whatsapp, it's really great how you people listened my request..üòä"
5,"I'd love to see an update where if someone sends me a voice note, I can highlight it like we normally do when we are referring to a message; this time around I get to text a timestamp or a time interval of the audio the person sent. Like for instance, I refer the person to the audio and write '0:13' or '0:15-0:30', and when I send this text it shows as a selectable item. The person then taps on this timestamp and then it begins to play from that point in the highlighted voice note."
1,After the last update my voice message keep hanging my phone. Whenever I tries to use my voice message my phone froze!!!!
4,"Everything is good but recently I'm facing a particular issue with sending multiple files. I have uninstalled and reinstalled whatsapp, cleared all data, tried everything but it won't be fixed. Whenever I'm trying to send multiple documents, it just let me send one document at a time. I'm asking the authorities to help me fix this issue please."
1,"The call quality couldn't be worse on wireless headsets, same issues with Facebook and Instagram calls - the background noise is more prominent than the person who speaks. The speaker's voice is partly cancelled. It seem the opposite should be done - cancelling the background noise and optimising the speaker's voice. Please could you test the call function using Bluetooth before you release your next update?"
1,"This is some horrible experience. Every time I try to send something to any new contact, it sucks. This problem needs to be fixed ASAP."
4,Please include Auto download images/ files option in group chat . Since we are unable to download the past file if other person delete it after sometime.
1,Very bad experience....someone can see our call log history n chats i felt so bad ...plz do something..how can someone see another ppl wapp ..u all are just saying double security whr is ur double security..
1,Showing channel lists and not being able to remove or delete them. Don't need a channel list in the update section.
3,"I think status updates should be vertical and showing the latest update as it used to be, while channels should be horizontal..."
4,"Please provide an option to view data on when you viewed a recieved message. Much like the sender can. The sent time, delivered time, and the viewed time. All three are very important factors to know your impact on the sender and recipient you are interacting with. Yes you can make note metally or otherwise of when you viewed it, yet a log would be useful, as otherwise would be quite a task. Also, please include supports for Google Chromecast. Video calls on my TV using my phone cameraüëç"
1,"From 3 days ago the video lenght that can be recorded inside the chats, using WhatsApp Camera, dropped to 26 seconds. The previous cap of 1:26 was already too short, you could drop the feature entirely, tbh. Couldn't find any setting to make the videos longer and it's definitely not a storage issue as there's plenty of free space. Disappointing."
1,I'm trying to sign in into my WhatsApp account but they be telling me to use the official app. But I'm using the official app!!!! When I click on the get WhatsApp button it takes me right back to the place I started from. Just an endless hoop! Please fix this. I'm confused as to why y'all can't even recognize your app!!
3,Please add support for sharing High quality status too. The status video quality is very very poor. Kindly improve.
1,"Waahiyaat Update Ever, The best thing which i have liked about whatsapp is it's simple and personal not everyone can text you unless they have your contact but now you created public channel which sucks.. Kindly stop it..."
1,"When typing emojis, there is a blank space between the keypad and chat. Now I can't even see my muted statuses for people!!!"
1,"This app is showing distrubane and technical fault now. When i try to open it the title of ""please use official whatsapp this may contains risk"" although i use this whatsapp. Please try to resolve this problem."
2,"The notification for leaving a group chat is awkward and having the archived chats as the first to appear when you open the app is not ideal. If it's an archive, I assume it'll be somewhere more hidden where I don't have to look at it all the time. The profile picture quality is awful and you can only have one."
3,"Downgrade to 2 stars because video clips sent through WhatsApp only display as 1-2 seconds ""blip"" instead of the original format. There are no issues (so far) with voice messages. I am unable to locate a Setting parameter that changes this shortfall. Video calls work well most times without line delays (7/10)."
1,This new update is trash .. I'm giving you a 1 Star.. I can't search for contacts on status.. must I have to scroll endlessly before viewing someone's status? Trash trash trash
1,"Since 1week watssapp is very pathetic. Audios are not playing for click very irritating. Plz do correct the issue ASAP, MY APP was up to date till now."
5,Just devloped your fingerprint software quality (some time properly not working) And other functions are very very good.
1,"So lately my voice note has developed issues , it works sometimes and stops whenever it pleases I thought it was lack of storage but no it's a bug from the WhatsApp app I don't know how you guys can fix it because I won't hesitate to leave WhatsApp for good, I can't even view status ,receive, or send pictures or videos to anyone, making me look like a loner please I want the bugs fixed as soon as possible because I use my WhatsApp to work ........... Thank you"
1,"I know i am only one to say it "" you should have to give option of status quality "" bcz some people try to show quality on status but whats app compress the video so it feel like weird."
1,"I cannot even login to my account , it tells me i need the offcial whatsapp app to use my account but i am using the official app ...this is very bad and i do not encourage anyone to get this app as there are way better alternatives that have better customer support than this rubbish , they dont even have consultants to speak to ..utterly pathetic"
5,It is good. Make it more user friendly. Good service and friendly approach of delivery boy üëç goes a long way with your business.
4,"There is one problem I am recently facing that is we can't send photos in document format all together, only first photo selected will be delivered other selected photos doesn't. I have to select one photo at a time to send it in documents that's too time consuming. Do something about this problem . A suggestion also - While we post something on status , sometimes we do spelling mistakes and we have to delete the whole status to put correct spelling. Provide a feature of editing status caption."
4,Very good app for communication and for sending files but when I call there's so much noise in the background although there are no sound on my or my friends end pls fix this whatsapp
1,Updates are random. Some people get features early and some doesn't. I am talking about the main channel. Not beta. Fix this
1,Features Are Rolling Out But I Am Not Able To Use Any Of The New Features Like Chat Lock Hd Image(cant Send After Update) Even I Updated To Latest Version Fix It! Device(sm-j200g)
1,"WhatsApp Dp clarity getting reduced a lot ,it's blurry,Dp is something which is one-time placement , what is the point to keep blurred or reduced image clarity üëéüëé"
1,Last update sucks this app badly.....I couldn't open it and it's not working properly......all the time I inter in this app and it's not responding well.Plz fix this Bug
5,"Very good app easy to handle.after sending the message, how to edit and sending back the same."
5,"Have been very happy with the recent developments. Never had any problems with using WhatsApp and have used this in a business environment and never had any issues changing phones or with my other apps. Always take a backup and restore on new installs. Recently have been using the new linked device feature and now have two installations of the service on my Galaxy without any service issues, it just works! It's taken a while but WhatsApp have got this right rather than rush a feature out."
3,"It was a nice app.. it was useful for us in many ways. But more than the benefits there are lot of drawbacks in this app. Lot of people face many issues while using this app. So it will be better if u improve this app.. issues faced by me are 1.some times the messages will not get delivered although i have a good network. 2.when we have lot of Stickers, it is hard to search a sticker which we actually want to send. So if u make any folder like options to save our Stickers it will be helpful.."
2,"My WhatsApp have been having one main issue and that's picture quality, for instance, If I were to send a picture to someone, no matter how clear it is, it always turns up blurry on their device and I tried updating it yet the same issue occurs, I hope WhatsApp fixes this issue immediately because I'm tired of always sending pics to people's emails or other social media accounts when this would've been done faster with WhatsApp."
2,"This app is a simple way of communication, but I'll give it only 2 stars‚òÖ‚òÖ for its media, especially picture and video quality is very poor as well as the video call quality. if I post a video on my status with subtitles you can't read at all bcz they're blurry! Don't only improve the emojis also focus on your media quality."
1,"I have a problem with WhatsApp recently. There's an unknown bug I can solve on. Whenever I tried to call someone via WhatsApp, a millisecond later I got kick off from WhatsApp. I even tried to uninstall and install back but nothing changes, the bug still there. I hope this issue can be fix as soon as possible because it is awful to be keeping on."
1,New update is very very bad I'm not sure about this new whatapp update so please remove this version ü§¨ the new channel update is very irritating remove it or else I'm gonna delete this whatsaap.
1,1. Unable to watch status privately. 2. Cannot change a viewed update to missed update. 3. Cannot use two accounts on one device. 4. Provides user's data. 5. Shows number of muted groups and includes them on chat label. 6. Doesn't show who has and who hasn't received my message in group. 7. Stores data only on phone. Doesn't allow to transfer data and read data from sd card in settings. 8. Doesn't explain status settings in detail. 9. Auto theme change settings or slide show not available.
3,"I'm compelled to use this, by my boss at work, instead of texting... And I'm just not impressed. I mean, it is better for adding and removing people from a group... But beyond that feature, the way it handles the actual writing and sending of messages and pictures is just not great. I use this because I basically have to."
5,"Love whatsapp, and I wish all the best for the apps future development and growth! But it would be cool if the development team can create an option where you can add a video profile pic it would be really cool. So there should be two options a normal profile picture and a video profile picture ( GIF ) or something similar to that effect. But all in all, I'm enjoying whatsapp. Thank you to the development team of whatsapp. All the best!!!!"
3,"The talk text needs to be improved. USF the microphone evidently doesn't get the text right. My use of English is not that bad, but that talk text types something totally different than what I have said. It used to be better before the last update. It makes me hesitant to update. If anyone else has the same trouble, or knows what I mean, make note in review.somewhatS"
2,"App has been great for the majority of use, but most recent update has caused a bug. I cannot recieve or make video or standard calls through the app. When I try the app frequently crashes. I've tried clearing the cache and even restoring the app to it's original state, but the bug keeps happening."
3,"Whenever i received voice messages, i can't hear them. As soon as i hit the play button to hear the message, my screen become pitch black and freezed all the buttons meanwhile the voice message played in very low sound eventhough the volume button hit max. I really appreciate for many cool updates, but somehow this issue still not fixed, is it only happens in my phone (android)?"
1,"Hi, my whatsapp is not working since 3days. The Android app is not opening only. I tried restarting my device and reinstalling the app multiple times. After reinstalling, the app opens but the every next time, it's shows the same error. I mailed in customer support but there's been no resolution yet. Please help me resolve the issue as soon as possible. It's causing a lot of inconvenience, They blocked my number üò†üò†"
3,"FIX WHATSAPP!!!! Today was the second time in 2 months my WA crashed, previously I lost everything as backup restore didn't work even if you do backup. Today restore only untill Monday, after that, nothing restored as WA just showed up to 31% restoration and kept at that for hours, finally opening chats without a successful restore. And no, it's most definitely not my phone, it's not even 5 months old"
2,"The app is a very nice app and still my favourite. But the graphics is a no-no üëé. I made a video this morning only to upload it on my WhatsApp status and all I got was a blurry version of the video. Not only that, the actions no longer corresponded with the words which was not so in the original video. This is very disappointing because I'm very keen about my graphics. Although, if this could be fixed then I do owe you a five star rating üíØüòä."
3,"Camera is bad. Pic gets blurr after clicking. To view status again, need to go inside the persons profile and check. If seen once, there shud be an option to hold on the display picture for 2 secs and ask wnat to watch status or display pic? Now the app is getting crashed when we go on payment page to make payments or view transaction. Even after updating the app its still the same."
4,"Great app. Only issue I have, this far, is how very tasking it is to delete a WhatsApp contact. Some are deadüíî. Some turn out to be fraudstersü§¨...& there they are! Too much of a hassle. Other problems encountered, I suspect, are network related."
4,"any photos and videos that were sent on whatsapp, the quality is always the worst. it didnt just happen specifically on my phone, but others too, even if the real media file is on 4k, its always blurry. and ONLY EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, the media file is good. i hope it can be fix without any 'whatsapp premium' feature."
5,"I agree this is the best communication app and great for chatting. This app will always need to be up to date,so I decided to tell you some suggestions on the newest update. 1. We can recover messages 2. The background instead of white and black,you can add some more images from Google So that's all,hope you guys read my message"
5,"Nice app but , It will be good if there were chat reminders. This is what i mean: for instance if i could add a reminder ( only for me) to chat or groups that pops up at the top of the chat when i open them and reminds me of things like what next i have to talk about, rules, context , birthday dates and stuff . I've been waiting for that in updates for a while now and it's a cool functionality i think WhatsApp should definitely check out ."
3,"It's overall good. However, I would like to have an activities tab in which we can see activities of others (listening music, working on presentations, etc) so that we can see what the person is doing currently and text accordingly. It'll make sure that we don't disturb others while they're doing something important."
1,"The WhatsApp is working good for me, especially if I used it to view status and family and friends. But there's a problems with me like if I'm calling someone video call the cellular or wife is not working good for me. And I don't understand weather the problem is come out with my phone or the WhatsApp and then too if I recorded to someone it will takes a minutes before it's send so be cuz of that I don't understand it, and I'm still searching for that matter. But aside that, everything is well."
5,The whasapp is a good apps. It's use to be great. Not anymore upgrade. WhatsApp dose not recognition phones media lasts Android after the upgrade.this app is wonderful creativity and This is very nice app. My personal rating is 8 of 10 beacuse i don‚Äôt like the backup process here it would have been better if there was a permanent backup system i never had to do the backup also to see the active status here i have to go into someone else's inbox like in messenger if the profile picture it This is
1,I backed up before uninstalling it then installed it again. It's saying no back up available so I have lost everything. Never had this problem before. Not happy at all. I have given 1 star because it's not possible to put none! Gone from bad to shocking. My account is randomly locked & I cannot access it. Uninstalled & installed again... nothing! I am now unable to use WhatsApp unless I change phones & number.
5,Excellent app easy to use and perform it's function excellently well. But lately I can't watch videos from group chats it will be taking time to load. I have updated the version but still experiencing the problem I don't know if it's my network or from WhatsApp.
5,It great and wonderful so far.But there aer several glitches in the recent updates.Captions under forwarded media files aer not sent with the files . They aer send separatly even on staws up date posted. The filter to the midia files shared (especially picture) make it look blurry. Backing upto cloud has not been tbat easy especially for those with heavy chat histories.
5,"It's good easier and faster in use. But I have two challenges:(1) it doesn't allow for eddition of already sent messages. (2) when a sent message is deleted, they still show toboth pt the sign that a message was deleted."
3,"So far so Good,I have moved my ratings from 1 start to 3 stars because I think you people have reset that feature that allows everyone to see my status even if they haven't been online for some hours. But then Why does the picture/video quality reduce when u share a media file with ur contact or post on ur status. That's so bad. Pls work on it. If the picture quality starts coming out good, I give a full 5 stars. Thank you meta"
1,"Stop asking to backup files. Can't even look at messages now because of that idiotic screen. Also uploads images into your phone gallery despite denying permissions. Oh but you wanna view them in the app? Better let us access audio and music too haha. I hope whoever requires these ""features"" chews on a belt sander while it is running."
1,Use Whatapp for 15 years. On android then iOS and now Android again. Never had any problems with sharing my videos. Since I bought one of newslest phones with great camera quality of shared videos is terrible. Like video taken by toy camera or something. And I'm not exaggerating. You can barely see any detail. Video looks a bit like blocks with colours and shapes moving around. You are not even able to count fingers on my baby hand. Only recommend if you have an old android or iOS phone.
5,"""It is awesome!"" Was my before review and Friday 4th of August: I'm currently updating the app, but it is such a disappointment that it gets ""out of date"" and you can't open it again onless it's uppdated, it's really annoying, like Imagen if someone is in a rush to text their boss or such or the person didn't have time to uppdate it."
5,Thanks for putting in effort to improve this app continuously. I have some feature suggestions for WhatsApp: 1. Ability to do status view once. Just the same way you did for pictures and videos in private chats. 2. A space where people can make suggestions for WhatsApp. This on its own can help WhatsApp get better and get more frequent users. Feedback is a strong way for organizations to make their products better. 3. Ability to share screen during WhatsApp video calls. I'll pause here.
5,"Hey suggestion: you guys should add search and call filters. Like if someone is looking for something, and they know a few details, there should be a filter for date, contact, etc so that messages are easier to find if we can't think of meaningful words related to what we're looking for. The same with call, add filters to search. A lot of us to be looking specific calls and can't find it or we don't want to scroll for the estinated date."
3,"very annoying bug has been happening since January where after capturing photo it takes about 20 seconds for the photo to actually load. in that time the camera is still on, this is really annoying and has only been getting worse since the new updates."
4,Mostly a flawless app experience. Calls are great and so is video calling. Only suggestion would be to incorporate the 'edit' option of messages into a double tap instead of long pressing the message you want to edit.
4,"Almost perfect, 1 last thing, can you please add theme option to make unread message appear 1st everytime I open whatsapp? I know you already have that feature by clicking search button and filter unread, but can you give option to make it default? So evertime I open WhatsApp, the UNREAD will be appeared 1st. Really appreciate your time. Regards."
5,My experiences are that the app provides easy communication and transperency. Easy to use. Can be accessed at any time needed. The photos are always clearer. The app is good and commendable.
1,"Video & Regular Calls Always Dropping Omg! Every time my fianc√© & I try to connect and use the video features, the call constantly goes into ""reconnect"", struggles, and cuts off! Terrible quality. My baby likes this app, I just use it because he wants to. However, I am losing my faith. Please fix these bugs..."
3,"Mobile internal memory is highly important & expensive due to not upgradeable. WhatsApp save all software, chats, videos, audios & stickers on internal memory. After some months WhatsApp took almost 80% internal memory due to mobile needs to change or kickout WhatsApp. At least data, chats, videos, sounds, stickers must save or SD card. If WhatsApp didn't take action all users must shift on another application."
2,"Hi, Still issues with video status updates extremely blurry. I have highest quality upload ticked in settings. Experimented with 3 different 3rd party editing apps including inshot. Saved video in 1080 and 720 with different frame rates. Used different connectivity from fibre to wifi to mobile. Please can you check for a bug fix. Thx"
1,"Avoid updating the latest version (30 June 2023). After the updates, the app in Samsung A71 becomes very lag, the attach button is not working, and app crashes when I try to restore the backup. It also causes iPhone malfunctioning - usee not able to send voice messages."
5,It's functions are amazing. Both video and audio calls are very very fantastic. It's give better features more than the past experiences. I love it and I can recommend it everywhere to anybody to start using this app.
3,"The only issue I have is that WhatsApp should have the feature to automatically convert videos and pictures into files, transferring them in their original format. This way, the quality of the documents wouldn't be compromised. Apart from that, everything else is great."
5,"I can't remember when I started using this application, so it has been quite a long time! Recently, I discovered that I can lock individual chats for extra privacy and protection by locking the person's chat such that it goes into a folder. The folder is named Locked Chats, and you can only open it if you are using a biometric form of security. How I did it... I don't know! I'm hoping the developer can tell me how I did it! Locked Chat is in addition to securing my app with biometrics as well!"
5,"It's a really good app... I really like it 'cause it helps me to connect with my friends and i like the in-app video chat and audio call, except the fact that when I'm sending pictures or videos it compresses too much data and reduces the picture quality"
5,Very convenient means of messaging and receiving messages photos and forwarding of photos. How do l get a new version of Whatsapp Messenger in operation? I have not been able to use either old or new versions of Whatapp for more than 9 hours. Very frustrating indeed! Please help!
1,"Really I'm having bad experience with this application. It was good, but latest features including rotating screen while video calls are very disgusting. Please clear this issue as soon as possible. Good luck"
1,"The app used to be great, but recently, the message delivery has become incredibly slow. Nowadays, using the application feels more like browsing a website due to its sluggish UI and lack of responsiveness. Additionally, the quality of uploaded statuses has significantly decreased."
2,The backups on the device internal storage endup taking a lot of space. Not every message needs to be backed up! The design of the backup system seems to assume that infinite local capacity exists. Backup to SD and Google Drive or other cloud drive storage should be provided.
4,when I am in one chat while scrolling to see previous messages it suddenly scrolls automatically to very old messages and then I have to click button in bottom to bring to latest message and then start scrolling again to desired message. secondly there is option to scan other whatsapp person qr so as to start conversation. Navigation to that scan QR code is pritty difficult. only people who are tech savvy or use wp too much can find such option. you have make this scan QR button easily available
2,This app is amazing but the quality of images sent and uploaded on status is very poor. The limit on number of contacts to forward to is also unpleasant. If you can also provide an option of putting in another account so that I may have two registered accounts in the same app.
4,"Despite how fascinating the app is, I'll like to suggest that there be a feature where you can determine someone's online status without being in the chat itself. Like, from your list of chats, you should be able to see everyone online (maybe marked by green dots). Thanks."
4,"Yo, WhatsApp is the bomb for chatting with my peeps. But lemme tell ya, there are a couple of things they could do to make it even more awesome. First off, why can't they let us store our pics and vids right on their servers? It's a pain to restore this huge 5-10 GB backup every time I reinstall the app. Ain't nobody got time for that! Also, why the heck ain't my latest messages backing up instantly? WhatsApp, do us a solid and back up our convos in real-time. That'd be so lit!"
1,"Android phones are not functional with this app any longer. With Andriod 10, the current version of Android's operating system, you do not get a bubble or notification of a message. The only way to see if you have a message is to open whatsapp and look. This is wildly inefficient and seems to mean whatsapp only wants iPhone users. So, telegraph, signal, and other apps are an option - just not whatsapp. Sucks, I've been using whatsapp for years. Facebook always screws things up. Sorry, ""Meta."""
1,"I don't understand how they can justify a $35 per week subscription price. Everything this app offers can be done using my Fitbit, other than coaching, which I pay $80 per year for. I just did a one week trial and my coach did not show for our first appointment and didn't message me until like 24 hours later. Not worth the money."
2,"Whatsapp is a great app but I have problems on it now it was showing storage full and deleted many things just for me to open the WhatsApp app to see that it had been out of date and also did like that on Saturday but a file came up,scanned and it said click clean and I did and it started working but after that I saw a place that skip restore was in the right and restore at the left I mistakenly pressed skip restore and all my messages disappeared,Pls I need help to restore my messages."
1,"Whatsapp was fine yesterday and the day before, ect, but it's just suddenly stopped me from making calls. I press call and it goes to the calling screen but then it just hangs up straight away, and I tested it with someone else (my mum) and it said that I was ringing her but she couldn't pick up. Please fix this"
5,"This app is very important but I don't like the idea of automatic download of voice note, most of the time this things download and I don't listen to them. I want it to be optional, so that if you open one and finds it interesting you open the rest. Thanks"
1,"When i try to call someone it will partially load then it cuts off, it says it has a bug, restarted my phone, cleared the cache and even uninstalled the app and re installed it, still says that there's a bug in my phone, i can't call with anyone at all and it is ridiculous, just fix it like srsly"
5,"Whatsapp, why don't you try doing what Facebook did and move the top bar to the bottom of the screen. And make search icons bigger and more elderly friendly. Secondly please make the message or call buttons bigger when one clicks on a contacts icons. The pop up right now is pretty useless as the icons are all so small on huge phone screens. The ability to call or message a contact should be easily clickable within a thumbs length and big enough for fat fingers"
4,"Everytime I try to send videos, the end result is always glitched. There is nothing wrong with my phone, and the videos work on all other apps apart from WhatsApp. Other than that the app is good. Please fix the videos!!!"
5,"4 things to improve: 1. When One delete msg, there should be no remnant, ""this message was deleted"". 2. In video status, there should be auto-editor that divides longer video into multiple 30sec segments. OR remove the 30sec duration restriction or increase that upto 3 minutes minimum. 3. There should be external-Share option for files. 4. One can hide last seen but it's everyone's right to see one's 'online status'. There should be ""online green dot indicator"" on profile photo on main window."
1,"Old fashioned inconvenient messenger. However it is the same as Facebook. It is not possible to write to a person until adding to your contact list. It is not possible to send a big file. No stickers, emojis are redrawed for no reason. I hope once developers will realize that it is 2023 already ""Couldn't complete backup"" notification couldn't be closed and it uses your google disk. Reptiloids have to do perfect apps as a more perfect stage of evolution"
5,Voice call problam and another all as ok privacy no adds. Good for sharing document other use withing family I like this app location as good sharing photos pdf file all ok
5,The app does it's job ...although I'd appreciate it if there was a formal separation of groups and chats it gets all confusing and mixed up
2,New update has too many glitches when last version was flawless. Please look into it. It was flawless before and 5 stars
1,There no advantage for upgrading. ..... And today 11 Sept 2023 another upgrade need to continued using this app. This version worst than prevoius version. I dont know what the purpose of this new version.
1,The Channels feature is so irritating. Please remove it from status corner and also remove from WhatsApp. Don't try to convert whatsapp into Instagram.
3,It's good ... But I'm not able to watch a full 30 seconds status... it's always stopping at 10 ..
4,I don't like the new status update nor the channel update. It is making the app lose it's original look and now looks weird instead.
4,"Please add ""emoji and sticker"" option in ""profile change"" as well. Not only in groups but for ourself as well. Please."
1,"Whenever I download a video from Instagram and put it in WhatsApp status, the quality is not good kindly look into this problem and make it properly."
4,It's reliable and the messages send fast. I just wish you could üìå pin messages to the bottom.
4,This app is good but there is no option to change front wallpaper .. Please add this option.. Everyone want this option in there phone.
1,"The latest, updates instead of status is not at all good and I'm planning to switch to signal."
4,It's good but recently when I try to listen someone audio my screen goes black automatically and the voice will remain low
1,"I am using this app on my new phone (Galaxy S23 Ultra). The quality of the video sent through this app is very horrible. I understood it would compress when sending media, but it compresses way too high, and the quality of the video is even worse than my old Huawei phone. I've contacted the support, but their response are terrible, which kept on repeating the same steps that are not helping to solve the issue and straight away will close the ticket without assisting until solve. Truly sad."
4,Fantastic Services but the only thing missing is can't edit text after sent!! sometimes by mistake we do wrong spelling so later on we need to fix it by editing...i hope u understand what i mean
1,"Yoo, I don't understand why this App is frustrating me, have being trying to restore my Messages from my Old Phones to my New Phone since yesterday and it's not working ..."
5,"Hi sir good morning, my WhatsApp blocked since one month why this problem I don't know , I suffered till today and I tried so many times but hope less please activate , I am waiting for activation of my WhatsApp , it's not working till today, so that please activate as early as possible , thank you sir."
2,"The fact that we have to check your status like Facebook or Instagram story and check channels like the status is very annoying, why don't they put the channel like Facebook or Instagram story and like the status the way it was before"
1,Trying to login to my account not able to login and no proper customer care support. Only I get system generated replies for the queries it has been 5 days I am trying to login and not able to do it
4,"Hello,, i am using whatsapp for a long time when i am seeing whatsapp status the number is not seeing anywhere please fix this problem. Thankyou."
3,In the latest version of the app the security features like fingerprint doesn't work while opening whatsapp for the first time please fix it.
1,This app is worst they are blocking and saying iam not using original whatsapp even iam using this app and lost all my data unable to access there was no response from their support even I mailed them
1,"Suddenly my WhatsApp on Android not working ""Audio Recording & Video"" as of today *Sunday, July 30, 2023* Did everything & nothing is working. All permissions for Camera & Mic are enabled. I need help please!"
1,"This app is now irritating whenever I want to sign in on my LG-G5, but keeps on poping up that I need to use the official app when the app is already updated. Please help me and improve on this new updated app."
2,"My chat list is not updating. If I get new messages, that conversation is supposed to move to the top of the list. It's not. And I've restarted and cleared my cache. No good. Please fix ASAP"
1,"Oi , can't post video on status . Tried 20times already ,fix it Oiiii , can't even open the app now , always crash"
3,Overall Whatsapp experience is good. Developer should have an eye on the quality of photos and videos. Likewise whenever a photo or video is sent to somebody the overall quality becomes so poor. This is rubbish. I think that management will consider my point and work on it that is gonna provide the best user experience.
4,I don't like the new version of update. The update icon is not so useful. I don't like the channel icon
3,I'm using WhatsApp from 2016 it's really good but just update the images and videos quality while sending to contacts or status. It decrease the quality of videos and pictures while uploading to status
1,"Recently I have been facing a problem, because of which I have lost all the chats. At midnight I was shown there was some problems with my chats and I need to restore it. I clicked on the restore option but the app was crashing again and again before reaching the cent percent mark. And later I lost all my chats."
1,"Too bad i have failed to update the app, am so pissed And i have issues sending an audio message with this app even with the fact that i allowed in my settings"
3,"Can we have a feature for seeing our own ""last seen"" like you save your own number right, then you be able to check on your WhatsApp when were you last seen without turning the data on coz that'll obviously show you're online at the moment üòä"
4,"I noticed some faults recently that I don't like, I don't know if it's my phone but I don't think the fault if from my phone. Messages does not send on time, it's not as if I don't have data because by the time I entered another app it will work yet I will have to put my phone on airplane mode and turn it come several times before I will receive new messages and the one I already sent will go. So please work on that, that's why I rate it 4 star ‚≠ê..."
3,Please provide more archive settings.archive have disappeared even new messages came and should not show archive in the bottom of the screen. please provide more archive settings please lam kindly requesting
5,"WhatsApp is good. If you guys fix the voicenote-playing stuff, something to do with motion sensors that turn off the screen when you play a voicenote, or lower the voicenote volume, or automatically pause it... It's super annoying by the way. Stop that, mehn. I am so sick and tired of it. Let's speak the truth. How does that help??? Huh? Just scrap it mehn. Or make it optional. It tempts my patience everytime. Thank you."
1,"Backing up messages block users to use whatsapp, it should backup in background, why did all the status combined, it should have filtered with seen and unseens status"
4,"This app is the best among all apps, but you guys need to add more relevant features like anti delete, and many more. thanks, love you guys. let the good work continue. But one feature is left to be added, you guys need to allow saving and copy of post on status. I'm tired of screenshoting all the times. Please üôèüôè add the feature to enable people saving post in status directly."
5,I love this app because every others whats app are not work properly and they are harmful for your mobile phone and your data but this work properly and also not harm ful for your device and data
2,"Sometimes my messages aren't sent, sometimes messages aren't received...get ur act together WhatsApp and sort the problems out."
1,new emoji window worst than before. not user friendly. makes use impossible to view which emoji you're using. don't upgrade il you can.
1,Garbage who comes up with such utterly garbage update idea pls leave this app alone don't copy features from all over the place and dumb it here. I completely repulse this update . Totally don't see a point of it
2,The channels update is very annoying. There's no option to remove it either.
1,This channel feature is very pathetic.....whatsapp is grave threat to privacy.... The idea of origin of whatsapp....is now totally shattered in pieces . One of the most unfriendly but sadly consumable app now in daily use
5,Best messaging app in this world we start extolling our virtues in it. Sending comedy messages which makes us and others laugh. I was astonished by the new features which have came in the new update. The owner is an astute who made this app.
5,Whatsapp owners are very big hearted because whenever I install apps or games from play store they must have ads but only Whatsapp have no ad I am very thankful to the WhatsApp owner to make app like that.
4,Day by day it's get updated & includes new features & it becomes more worst . Old simple whatsapp was fabulous because that wasn't full of bugs & glitches
1,Channels feature is unnecessary distraction. It's better if WhatsApp adds a new feature to hide the channels feature
1,"Please bring option to disable the find channels and the suggestions.., bcz of these reels people only I'm not using the instagram/tiktok .. noise I don't want to see them on WhatsApp.."
5,"I just want you to add the feature that, iif I have muted someone's chat and they send me a message that message should be just sent and not delivered until we unarchived that chat even we have opened and read the message."
2,"Cannot upload video to status cannot send to contact also something is wrong, been having this problem for a long time now please fix this issue"
5,"Amazing app. Great for conversations on any device even if you don't use the same OS as your friends and other people meaning you can message someone who uses IOS from Android OS or the opposite. Easy to send texts,images,videos,audios,file etc. Calls and other files are high quality. Highly recommended for people over 13,16 etc. Depending on the country you live in."
4,I am giving you 4 stars because dp is photo small size and there are some bugs are there but WhatsApp is awesome and great experience but make dp size bigger photos for best quality photos
4,Pls improve the security aspect so the hackers we not have access to people's phone number. When expired i can't upgrade to new version
1,"This app is a big trash, the worst I have come across. More than a month this app cannot verify my number, so frustrating app"
1,Since today I am not able to send multiple photos as document format at a time. It only sends the first photo and all the rest i selected are left. Also there's an issue with the status. When my contacts uploads status it is not available or visible in the status option but in the chats. I have to search them individually in order to view their status... Kindly look into this issue and fix this as soon as possible. My phone is one plus Nord 2
5,The new update is great. Whatsapp used to ruin picture graphics but now you can send pictures in HD quality.
1,I am using Whatsapp since 5 years. It is ease to use. But new update is trouble. I don't link new updates menu whith channels
4,WhatsApp video doesn't silent why .when call come I press power button doesn't silent .after that I come home screen press power button then do access. Why this is problem in WhatsApp video call
5,"I love Whatsapp cause it's the best app for chatting, voicenotes, voice and video calls and many more It's fast reliable and easy to use"
3,"What happened to mute update?? Since the latest update that has channels added to the app, we can't see muted update again."
5,Best App for communication But there are some loops that other social media uses in there favor. If whatsapp use or add some unique and informative topic in WhatsApp this could be cover whole social media üëç
5,Overall this app is useful and good but one new update which I don't like is the update of status please change that feature becaus I know most of the people don't like this new featureüòä
3,"I'm not liking the new feature of popular channel and hiw status are shown , want it to be a sweet and simple messenger app as it was earlier."
1,I don't like that What's app saves every picture in a chat regardless if you sent it or not. I would like it more if I had the option on whether I want the picture to be save in my phone's storage or not. I also hate that in order to see a picture in a chat that I have to allow what's app to save/download the picture in my phones storage. It would be nicer if I didn't have to do that and if I want to save a picture I have the choice when I tap the picture and it gives me a choice to save it
4,"Uhm, is it possible to add a feature that let's a person send a message in the present, that will only be delivered to the recipient on a set date and time. Sort of like sending a message to the future?"
1,Pin to Top Option does not work for this app.. My device gets stopped by that option whenever msg comes from that Pin to Top contact. Asking to fix this.
2,"I've been receiving loads of spam messages within the app from all over the world and nothing we (including friends and relatives) can do to stop it. I tap on ""Report"" which blocks those specific senders, but there are always loads of new ones popping up. Hope the app can improve FAST or hope ppl move on to other options."
2,"WhatsApp software developers, increase the 30 seconds limit on statuses, let WhatsApp users be able to post a video of 1 minute on their status without having to divide it into two 30 seconds videos....this is one of the reasons people are quitting WhatsApp to GBwhatsapp and FMwhatsapp."
5,"This app is good for messages, business, home, family, but it's just a bit mystical, it doesn't give the best quality in 1080 size video, please give the best quality. Hello friends if you do sports then this problem can be solved üëç Whatsapp Best üî• Whatsapp Super üòé Whatsapp Hiro üîó But Video quality hd 1080 size problem Thank you so much"
2,This is a great app and I use it everyday but why the hell have they change the pop-up view in calls?! It is so annoying!! The picture is never accurate to the way the camera is facing and the black box goes around it and makes it all worse. Video calls were so much better until this update I'm infuriated. Sort it out.
2,"hello watsapp support team, I m facing the problem that ‚Äòyou need the official watsapp to use this account‚Äô Even though I m using official watsapp, this issue I m facing from over one month and I updated my issue in watsapp support like five to four times but still I can't solve this issue, watsapp team this is my kind request please help me to solve this issue please reply watsapp teamüôèüôèüôè"
3,"Till now all is good . I would like to suggest an additional feature , that is to mark status as read , and there by saving data , it may be insignificant but can avoid repeated content for those who prefer that. Also the option to restore backup is asked only once. That's a drawback."
5,It would be great if there were an option to be able to answer the video calls as voice calls for the cases of not being convenient for video call but still want to answer the call. Another thing is that it's be great to be able to set a schedule for the messages. Like send this message 2 hours later or tomorrow at 9.00 o'clock.
3,"It is good bt im not satisfied because my contacts status dont appear after i have changed whatsapp number and some friends says they are blocked, How and Why? What should i do?"
2,The latest version was not good in the status it was showing some channel... I was getting some disturbance ...
1,"From 2 weeks ago when I put an emoji on text block, the text block comes down in the keyboard, behind it, and you can see only a half of the text block. And when you send a message the text block it's on two lines and without any text until you press it..."
3,My overall experience in using this app has been good but the problem arises when I make video calls. Off late my video call suddenly starts lagging which is not due to the network or my phone being outdated. The lag also affects my phone performance when i minimize the video call tab and use some other app. It started happening from the past couple of weeks.
3,"I wonder why there are channels on WhatsApp? Not cool Also when a message is deleted, let it just disappear instead of showing that something was deleted 4/10 imo"
4,"tbh you can change interface to more smooth things, it will be better and i'm not sure for privacy when i use this app."
1,What is the issue on whatsapp i no longer get my varification code on my ugandan airtel number and im in a foreign country kindly help me what to do i changed the phone n installed whatsapp but no varification they keep telling me try after one hour its now 8 days whats the matter
1,"Gating worse day by day,why you add chanel feature with get a option to use it or not!!! That's irritating things."
1,"hello whatsapp team! my experience with your app was really great so far not until when i experienced problems and glitches in whatsapp picture-in-picture. whenever i am in a video call with someone and i try to minimize it, the icon glitches and blinks a lot of times and i can't even move it around until it stops blinking but it takes almost a minute to be functional the way it used to. i am looking forward for this issue to be fixed and thank you!"
1,"In recent update , when I share some pics using documents option to send original quality, only one pic is going, not all the selected ones, in previous , I'm able to send almost 10 pics like this, without quality lack, but now, how many I will select, there is only one pic among them which is going to the contact This is very very ridiculous thing - some say select latest option which you send direct pics without quality loss by going into settings, but thats also not working, shame , its fake"
1,The new feature of rolling up emoji is very frustrating. I hope it will get better like before.
4,"App is improving everyday but I can't find option to adjust media upload quality. Please, guide me to how to get that done"
5,Please kindly have an option whereby you can download two WhatsApp on one phone as there are phones that has two sims. Kindly look into to this.
3,Please do some more update because it's giving me blank and wide space when I switch from normal keyboard to emoji. Very wide indeed Thanks.
5,This is very good i am happy to send video note. But you should add the option to forward this video note to anyone.. please update.... Thank you
1,Now a days whatsapp is going to be very much pathetic. This is giving useless update and making the app size bigger. Today I got a update where I saw channels this is to much useless update. I am giving you 1 star if you removed that useless update I will remove my comment. Try to give best features instead of giving useless features.
2,"The app being unassesible for a whole day, I had to delete it to reinstall it. Up to now I can't install it."
5,A new feature should be added.. Status should be uploaded in HD. It should ask to upload status in HD or not.
1,worst application i can't login to my account. whenever I'm trying to get a verification code or call it always showing me that we couldn't send code to your number please check your number and try again after 1 hour but all the time I'm putting the right number. and it's happening again and again for 3 days.
4,It's very nice app for everything but when I saw my friends status sometime its show 'there was an error playing this video ' . Please solve it. I try many times but couldn't solve it. Please help me as soon as possible
2,My number was logged out of whatsapp again Please what's going on I need to use my whatsapp now I'm working with it too This keeps happening and it's really annoying Might have an important message from my Boss and I can't reply..why?? Coz I was logged out from whatsapp!!! It's really frustrating
5,"WhatsApp is a great app you can chat with peopl, call peopel, and many other stuff of communication... The best thing is that it's always to be updated maybe like monthly and you choose whether to or not ..when updated it brings nice interesting effects ... that's all I can say"
1,WhatsApp messenger seems as if it's now captured by some autocratic business elements who have their motives deeply rooted in self enrichment.Updates processes are not at client compliance. 1) Data consumption as app adverts pop in for no reason and automatically download without consent. 2) Disappearing messages should be only cater for the one who saved it *installer* for own messages not for recipient. 3)Emojis features now a disgrace and annoying. NB Please the old WhatsApp was better
3,"Just a suggestion. Can an undo and redo ""features"" be included into the app system? We need to undo and redo writings. It makes it a lot easier than typing all over. Thanks."
1,"The sharing option is very slow and the app almost crashes and don't let me see who I am want to share it. When I try to do a sharing ( link, v√≠deo, from other app) to a Friend in whatsapp . Please, fix that."
3,"Recently I muted and archived a few chats because those chats have like 100 messages per minute. However, I still get notifications from these archived chats. Why am I getting notifications from these groups? It's really problematic. Please help."
1,"Whenever I am trying to search anything from any WhatsApp group,the results are not accurate. Please do the needful."
3,everything great but can you please add a scroll button for chats in case chat with a person is too long its impossible to reach at the top and an option to hide someone's chat as it is in gb whatsapp version . please have a look at it. thankyou
4,"it's reliable, zuck added some cool features, but that ""edit"" message button needs to last longer than 15 minutes. maybe 2 to 3 days is fine."
5,"No matter how much I say, it will be an understatement. It is one of my favorite social media. Love it all features. üñ§‚ò∫Ô∏è"
3,"Very nice app, but the only problem I'm having is that the chat lock feature only works if it's fingerprint please it will really be nice o have a password or code or pin, not just fingerprint and my status views have reduced drastically, why is this"
4,"Please add one more feature in whatsapp that one can type a message at any time and set an alarm to send that message at a particular time automatically. like,Onetype a birthday greetings at 10.30 pm and set an alarm to send that msg at 12.00 am. That msg reaches to reciever automatically at that time."
3,"Good app, unfortunately you can't record video or audio calls. What if I'm having online classes and can't record them. I'm a computer programmer, please take this into consideration."
5,"""Hi my name is Rahul . I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate WhatsApp. It's been such a great tool for staying connected with friends and family. The ease of use, reliability, and constant updates make it one of my favorite apps. Thank you for providing such a valuable platform for communication! üòäüì±"
1,"Very worst update now,the quality of video status is very low. Earlier version is much better than now. I full hated this version üò§. Status duration is very limited only 30 sec ,but ints is much better than WhatsApp."
4,"Everything is perfect on Whatsapp, the privacy, the easy chart, and so on. But the only thing I've been waiting for is the save status button"
3,Don't involve Channel etc.. This is private messaging app that is great but adding new useless features like channel etc is bad idea you will lose your rating.
3,It is a very good app to have but the issue when I post a video on my status with good quality but then when it uploaded all over sudden the quality drops making my video glitch and have very poor quality
1,The new ui with the navigation tools down the screen is just utterly ridiculous...please rool out the old version or give options to change that.
4,"Its a good app. I have been using it for a while. Though I cannot save other people statuses,,,it requires a WhatsApp status downloader,,,that's quite boring because it takes up alot of space."
5,"Absolutely frustrating, can't add new contacts anymore dunno why. That was 6 months ago....I have solved the problem.... It's quite the best messaging app ever...‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 10 üåü"
5,"*New: Edit your sent messages* Made a small mistake typing that message? No big deal. Now you can easily edit messages for up to 15 minutes after sending them, whether you want to undo an error or change up an emoji."
4,"There should be an option to rename the file ,while sending to someone. When we send photos in doc. Format ,then there should be an option for giving particular name to that file."
1,"Not running the latest version, but BEFORE a recent update, everything was working FINE. AFTER the recent update, WhatsApp STOPPED MAKING NOTIFICATION NOISES, even though the settings are set to MAKE NOTIFICATION SOUNDS. META! TEST YOUR UPDATES, PLEASE!"
3,"Its very good with easy access to status viewing and everything,a good and reliable way to talk with friends safely,but I don't understand why they keep telling me that I'm not using the original whatsapp when its obviously the WhatsApp messenger that I'm using"
1,You should have a option to disable channel. Which i don't need!!! Or at least whatsapp business no such channel for work not for pleasure!! I want a light weight whatsapp not with so much junk info. If I need i can get info elsewhere!! Call is horrible with wifi or data both BAD.
1,"I blocked a contract very long time ago but shown me as I blocked that contact today. Realy frustrating, what was the bug. And also the last seen thing, after being offline there is shown as online for 2 min, I hate this bug fix it."
5,"I just love the app,it is really helpful,and it reduces the stress of calling,it is a really great app for chatting,and they always upgrade it which also makes the app fun"
3,I don't know why my WhatsApp keeps displaying backing up messages around 2 o'clock in the morning. I don't backup my messages and I don't see any reason to. Can you please stop it
1,WhatsApp says your account has been banned but haven't done anything that gaoes against the rules. When my account recovers for a few hours I receive messages from international numbers. It's been almost a month now. I'm so fed up with this.
1,Very poor . When ever I update my status picture quality drops exponentially. And I use a Samsung galaxy s9+. This issue is Mostly dominant in Android phones
5,"WhatsApp is a top-rated messaging app that has become a staple for users around the world. Its user-friendly interface, reliable performance, and strong security features make it a popular choice for both personal and business use..."
4,What's app should allow at least 5 chats to pin up.And the other thing which is most important that even if the recipients phone is off then also what's app voice call ring goes on ringing.. you people should work on it.
3,My account just got banned while adding numbers to a WhatsApp group. I was adding numbers for my organisation group and there were more than 500 numbers. I didn't know that was issue. But I was not doing anything suspicious. I work in environmental ngo. And i was just adding numbers for a group we created. Please please please unban it. It's my personal what'sapp and i have many important chats in it and I was not doing anything suspicious. Please unban my account. Please!!!
3,"Everything is goodüòÅ exceptüò∂, that we can't share message to more than 5 peopleüëª and it creats lot of problemsüò° for but in older versionüèöÔ∏è it is avilable in 2015 I think."
3,It'll be really great and I'll start posting on WhatsApp status more if there could be a feature to add songs to status or being a picture I post in status.
5,"Very Nice App. It is easy to use . And we can send message instantly with Photos, Videos, and Voice Message , And Message. We can also do payment with the Whatsapp and we can send monaey to anyone."
1,"Latest update was so bad, the channel was so useless like why?? Who need that and more easy to use compare to before and the emoji button was so annoying to use. Shame on you who make the app more worst."
2,The latest update is not clean. Please have an option to disable the channels feature. Why you guys are making it messy....
1,The newly updated features are rubbish. Absolutely nonsense. Once my signal is off then I come back online i won't be able to see all the statuses posted then. Please remove that feature. It's becoming deceitful
3,"There is a bug that i found when i want to use stickers, everytime i open my stickers or emojis, the chat history dissapears, because of that i cant see what they send when i open the stickers or emojis, please WhatsApp fix, its really bothering me, thank you"
4,whatsapp is very good because we can communicate with people who are far away but can be close and I can also communicate with youtubers who give me their whatsapp number and can... I hope that later there will be a more luxurious feature than usual I hope so.
5,"Fabulous experience, the app is doing great !. I bet everyone just loves the reaction feature yet, just a request - pls give a double tap feature just like in Instagram."
4,"What'sApp is an engaging App for real sense... and saves multiple data. But, I try to restore my backup lost data all to no avail. There's no need for now anyway am still enjoying What'sApp."
2,"This app is total rubbish, because i dont know the reason why you will be my account can not use whatsapp, have not been able to chat with my first line since and i registered with my other line and taht one also did the same this morning.... I regret downloaded this app... I cant even enjoy my chat in peace."
1,"Please can you do something about the reduction of video quality, because we've been posting some videos and the qualities are just being reduced, we would really appreciate it if you would do something about it quickly, thank you"
1,"after update, the tab emojis and sticker are sucks.. dont know how to say.. the tab are way too higher.. when I try to put an emoji it doesnt appear.. is it lagg.. error.. I dont knw.. it just getting worse."
3,"I must say, i enjoy the app, but could you please add the @everyone option for group chats, im on several groups and its painful having to @ each person individually when trying to tag everyone. Thanks"
3,"So far so good, just remove ""This message was deleted"" , it's a bit too annoying. People should be able to delete a text without others knowing about it."
4,This app is very good but I want to give some suggestion. WhatsApp should include anti-screenshot feature which can stop people to take screenshot of profile photo and status photos. Please consider it as it can enhance privacy of user.
3,"App is great but many times in chats, the other person's chats or messages are delayed b4 u see them. This will make you think the other person is offline. Please fix this"
1,The recent update from WhatsApp has moved the status bar down giving a more tedious look. I hope whatsapp would look into this issue and restore it back to its original state.
4,"I request you people to add a option in which we can edit our messages, also I want to not show "" this message is deleted "" to others when we delete out messages, anyways good app!"
1,Image and Video quality being shared through WhatsApp needs to be drastically improved. Absolutely ridiculous how bad the images/pictures and videos look after being shaped üëéüèªüíØ.
1,"Only one star because When listening to a voice message, I don't put the phone on my ear and it automatically turns off the screen and turns off the voice."
5,"WhatsApp is the best app I've ever had, it's reliable, secure, and really useful. Updates are usually adding up to the amazing app fearures, well done developers and keep it up üëçüèª"
1,"This app is a better way of communicating with family and friends, however it is now developing some challenges. I am frequently blocked from using it but l don't violate it's rules so I wonder what is it that cause this problem"
5,This is so good and I like it .Because we have so much funny emogis and stickers and with the help of stickers and emojis we can show our feelings. Yeah that's so good I like it and I always use this messenger üôÇüôÇ
1,It provides very poor service I reached out WhatsApp service team many times but they are not able to solve my problem Due to this I am unable to get my important work and documents This is worst situation faced by me So pls don't use such type of apps
2,"Whatsapp keeps my number blocking from using services, every other day it logs me off. This is happening since past 2 weeks, despite I have been usimg it since last 7 years on the same number"
1,"the change on the sticker placement is annoying, it would automatically to your stickers bank, not the latest/fav stickers.. simple but really really annoying"
5,Yaaaaaaa!!!!! hoooooooooo!!!!!! what a nice app and best platform for communication meta produces a best app (WHATS APP MESSENGER) this is one of th best communication platform that I have ever seen my n my experiance one meta's success
4,I will give you four stars üå† coz am little bit disturbed while am using the app listening to audios the screen suddenly turns black and the audio volume goes down low inaudible it's annoying fix that I will give you five Stars
5,I love WhatsApp but I'd like to suggest you guys add the option that allows group admins to pin certain messages in the group so old and even newly joined members of the group can see this messages.
1,"I have been unable to use my WhatsApp for over two months, I can't even log in so frustrating, WhatsApp keeps telling me number not verified Is this how you people works I rate it 1 star because you guys don't resolve issues in time"
3,Bring an update where we can delete STICKERS separately from our chat without deleting the entire chat in order to free up space like earlier times where we could delete chats stickers photos or videos separately!!!!
2,"This App is very useful to me, it helps in terms of contacting my family abroad and in my country, so I prefare using it more than any social platforms but on the way I faced some difficulties where by I got blocked this App. For using my own language of which was not harmful to anyone, so I plead to be unblocked so that I can keep this WhatsApp business going N I promise to be more vigilant next time. I can be very delighted if you unblock me I really wanna be part of this App Thank you all."
5,"Very good app, ,It makes one connected, I love it ,Also Educating , For my view it's the best because I communicate privately,more good things to write about it, Keep up the good work please"
5,Hello WhatsApp team You guys are doing great job to serve us awesome. I would like to share a suggestion on the features: - Message Scheduling feature would be added advantage Thanks in advance
4,The quality of status should be improved. Because the photos and videos we upload on status are not clear. It's hazy.
2,"Dear whatsapp, one thing i can't understand why this social media app (whatsapp) dose not provide the best resolution for uploaded video/photo on status ?? Please resolve it as soon as possible. Thank you."
5,It is bad aap because whenever I try to talk with any girl.she block me. I request you Whatsapp's owner to disable the block option. Moreover it is an excellent appüòäüòä
1,"Screen sharing is useless and it's problematic.. WhatsApp is going backwards because of the bad updates. Earlier everyone says Whatsapp is the most privaciest app but now it's also becoming like a GB,FM whatsapp. Worst experience when comparing earlier whatsapp"
4,There's not any option to edit your caption on your status. I think that's the major problem with WhatsApp. Rest is best...
3,"Don't like whatsapp anymore, just because of status.. b4 we can see other status anytime and now its only appears one time. Really don't like it."
4,"I call to several countries and of course here in the United States also. It works awesome, this app is just awesome. The only problem I have with it I change phones back-and-forth and every time did I change to another phone I cannot transfer my app to it, comma like this phone that I'm using I haven't been able to use what's app for at least 6 months now. I have called support and they send me some messages that I don't understand. What I wish support would do is call us and give a step-by-ste"
1,"Whatsapp was very good before i updated, and now i don't like it anymore. Why did whatsapp change the icon statuses into updates and i don't like the fratures and channels, and so badly i don't like that too. Why i can't see the muted statusesüò° omg whatsapp hates u now! I just started using telegram"
1,Performance issue. App is running slow. Status tab taking more time than usual. I'm using optical fibre based 5g network. Still it's not fixed!!
1,In this update there was change in interface of status they add many channels of influencers . I am frustrated with this plz whatsapp remove this . Or reply me @whatsapp
5,"I really like this WhatsApp & it's really helpful & make things easier for me to know people from other countries, friends, families and work mates . I really appreciate it . Yes I really love this network very fast and easy to chat with my friends, family & other people around the world.. thanks to this apps.."
4,"The call experience has to be the worst, but the rest is really good. The messaging has a lot of privacy options that I enjoy. Nice app"
2,"I loved this app till now. It was my main app, I could send videos up to 35 min then they cut it down to 22 min now it's cut again down to 5 minutes so went to sending audios up to 30 minutes and today I went to send one and couldn't do it because it's cut down to 16 MB. Why would you change something so good into something no longer able to do. Please change it back.üò•"
1,"Hi I am really getting irritated with this find peopl/page how do I unfollow or hide it or remove it , i am not getting any option to delete? do i need to uninstall the app and re install, kindly let me know if there is any way I can close tat option ."
5,"Thank you very much,,, for gifting us such a beautiful and functional item. I can talk to my love, because of your app,,, thank you very much Thank you very much to your whole team üôè ,,, I am speaking from Bangladesh. ü•∞ü•Äüòá‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,Sir there was a problem my WhatsApp account is not working after the day and when i opened it .it say you need the official WhatsApp to use this account . And say to log back in or register a new account make sure you are using WhatsApp and when i try this way . It will repeated
2,"I cant do voicenotes because for some reason known to y'all it doesn't send and neither can I listen to them, no matter the amount of data or wifi I use. Also I see the status updates but anytime I try to check it it doesn't load no matter what I do, and no it's not my network because other apps are working just fine Fix it as soon as possible it's annoyingüòí"
3,It would have been nice if there was a music system while giving statuses like Facebook and Instagram have.
1,Worst experience ever. I took backup still didn't able to take back my photos and chats. Kindly up your technology üôèüèª
3,"I went to do the update for the text edit feature, but i don't see an update option when I go to the app store"
5,"Worst experience When I want to verify my phone number message displayed on screen ""you need the official WhatsApp to use this account"". While I have re- downloaded the whatsapp. Kindly resolve the issue at earliest"
2,Once i upload a profile picture HD from whatsapp.... but I'll see again profile picture was not clear..... Its look like a bad(low quality image) bacause of tha picture pixel was damaged
1,if u want to let user edit their messages dont just put a 15min timespan. its very embarassing when u post an important message/announcement in a group with a typo and noticing it a few hours after sending
4,"Very useful and always your champian companion, when you need someone this along 100's of your contracts are always live, without worrying of balance in account."
1,"I can view my on status for 12 second only and the resolution is very low,when i looked on the setting,there is no features to solve this problem"
1,"Dear developer, please remove recent update from WhatsApp. It is very inconvenient to use app. The sticker and emoji tray are not working at all in the new update .... Just remove it and make WhatsApp earlier like it was .... Thankyou Don't ignore. Have a look"
2,"Have used this app for over a decade, used to be my favorite messaging app until about a month ago. No longer able to send any videos. Contacted support, it took three days at one message per day just to have them tell me it must be my phone and not their problem. By the reviews and the research online, I'm finding it hard to believe it is my 2 year old phone that is not able to process videos! What a shame for what used to be a great platform!"
1,"So far till now WhatsApp was A great app, But with the new update they really made it a mess . First it was simple and clean now it is messed like others app , they made a mistake of adding channels into it"
2,"After re installing whatsapp app (backup and all) my contacts were messed up, lost my pictures and videos. My group chats have been separated from my individual chats and don't know how to sync them so they can all show on same WhatsApp home page. Very disappointed üòû because I have lost my data"
1,Notifications don't work and it doesn't have nothing new or good to offer. It's trash.
4,Hello watsapp From the last update status is not uploading orginal quality of vedio. Please fix this problem or provide the setting in to upload the orginal quality of vedio. Thank you .
1,"Too many bugs now, I see new status circles in few people profile, then before i click on them, it suddenly refreshes and their status is then suddenly no more visible. They are literally gone, why such stupid issues?? Also I'm getting logged out automatically frequently . Also add another feature to prohibit people from coping my status without my permission."
5,"It is such an amazing app . It really helps me to be in the contact with my family, friends,relatives etc . I am really thankful for the person who is the owner of this appüòÉ"
5,Very useful and important WhatsApp. making people to communicate easily with each other.
2,"I had it on 5 stars now I had to change it to 2 because I hate the 2 way verification pin because since I did that it said my pin was wrong. There's no way because I used only one type of pin for just that and now I can't get off the verification screen to see my messages. All I was trying to do was update my phone number on whatsapp and then this happens. Want my advice? DON'T FIX, WHAT ISN'T BROKE!!!!"
5,"Such a great app with lots of amazing features. Was just wondering if it could be possible to pin messages in a particular chat. It'd also be nice if ""play in background"" can be enabled for voice messages Whatsapp, please now let there be a select all check box for forwarding messages. I can't be sending reminders to over 2000 people in batches of 5üòî"
1,"Last week I lost all my contacts, only their numbers appear also even with settings set to be notified all messages just vibrate. Pls help"
5,This app is very faster and easy way to communicate to other state or country. That why I will give his five star rating.
3,"I have been using this app for so many years, and it has never had a problem with it until now. This app has a bug that doesn't allow me to make normal calls or video call, when I try to do any of that, it kicks me out of the call. The only thing that I can do normally is send text and voice messages."
1,"Since latest update, the chat is glitching when sending a message. Would be great if you fixed that."
3,"Why is the app not working like before???? right now, I'm failing to see my WhatsApp contacts, and there status.... For this: I'm giving you 3‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ês.... But help me for the app to receive üíØ%‚≠ês"
5,I love all the new features of the update that has been taken I think the annoying people that are message again and again I archives them and they never comes up . THANKS FOR THIS WONDERABLE UPDATE ..SEJAL‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1,Bad Exprians . Bad. Very bad. I don't like and i dont understand. Sometimes runing this app mostly this app is not working. Am facing Coninusaly trouble. If this app is not working then plz off this app
2,There should be an option to lock only whatsapp with pin. Navigation Panel has not changed on my phone.
2,"Please fix the stickers menu, it's so buggy and clunky. Fix it or revert it back to what it was."
1,"I have discovered that another reviewer has commented on the same difficulty I am having. I attach photos to a message, but when I send, only the photos get sent, the explanatory message I had written and taken time to compose has been deleted and not sent. I have to write it all over again and send separately to the photos. This irritating and unnecessary change only emerged on my device since the last WhatsApp update on 08/05/2023. Please change it back WhatsApp, or fix the bug causing it."
4,Cool feature in update but please include status saver download in your next update Downloading a different application for status saver is not wise.. Include language translation also Thanks
4,I have find that this review very important and good image instrateration and fine for communication luther than using direct call. I benefit from this app
5,It's being more interesting to use the app after the new updates..but what if we had a new option like to add a wallpaper to our chats section..
3,"After the new update of WhatsApp it is good, but the dashboard of WhatsApp Status and Channels can be improved !! Plz improve dashboard of Channels."
3,"The dictionary is awful. Words in your Dictionary are not in Collins or Oxford dictionaries or Thesaurus. I hate that I can not mute the sound without having to turn my phone volume down. The adverts are repetitive - temu for instance - and there after every single move. I limited my time to avoid brainwashing and irritation. Go in with your eyes open. Too many game options, too many ads, no longer a happy place."
2,"It's second time When I tried to open my account again on any other mobile, I got no OTP verification, I even sent several emails to WhatsApp support but got no response."
1,"There is a bug in the new update of WhatsApp due to which there are many problems that DP update is not happening, so another update should be given as soon as possible so that all these problems are solved."
1,The new update to stories is annoying. I dont want to follow random strangers. Give us an option to hide them!
1,"When I receive calls from WhatsApp, only a sound appears, but I do not know who is calling, but when I enter WhatsApp, the caller does not appear on the lock screen. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé"
1,"Worsen.. Harmful application, because: üî¥ Forced update, although it works fine!!?? üî¥ Forced backup, again more forced!!?? üî¥ It needs more storage space in the internal memory!! üî¥ More and more permissions to access the phone with each update?? üî¥ Little by little it is getting worse. üî¥ Finally I will look for another app."
2,I have been using WhatsApp for 3 years now and it has been a good experience for me until today. I opened WhatsApp and it said to restore my messages because there was a problem or something and then when the messages were restored I looked in my chats and everything was gone and now I am really annoyed because I had lots of important messages on there and I can't even get it back even though I backed up my messages. Is there some way of getting back these messages?
5,"I love using WhatsApp for messaging my friends and family, but I really wish there was an edit message feature. It's frustrating when I accidentally send a message with a typo or mistake and can't go back and fix it like I can on other messaging apps like Telegram. Please consider adding an edit message feature in a future update. It would make the app even better and more user-friendly. Thank you for your hard work"
5,It's a nice app for messaging and stuff. It has perfected messaging as we know it. They should add polls to status updates . And I think they should add the feature to change your captions at anytime.
2,Everytime i try open the document or photos or videos...I have to re-download it...It troubles when the data is off...
3,"This is really a nice app ,just a suggestion though.... If an upgrade could be possible on personalizing a password or lock chat option that would be nice, for instance if a password option can be introduced,so each chat that you won't want people to access even when they visit the WhatsApp app on your phone can be locked by you ,just like gallery where pictures are Access there's room for one to put some pictures to a secret folder and secured it with password....."
4,i m not getting whats app on my account.it is all of a sudden discontinued and not getting it in spite of . repeated efforts.i do not know the reason for disconnecting it.pl.revive it
5,It's a nice app for chatting and communited with people you have in contact with! And you can upload status and knowing other people status too! It's a needed app in order to sent message and video call.
2,"Not really happy on the new update version, the old version when you swipe on a message sent or the one you send that you want to reply it pops up your keyboard for you to type on but now it has changed, it now wait for you to tap before you type. Please you'll should look into."
1,Hey WhatsApp What is your problem man? I am updating always but my photos and videos are blur when I upload on status . The HD quality of photo that option is missing . Do something. The worst quality üò°
1,Why so hard to open same account in other devices. I changed my phone and tried to open my whatsapp account on my new phone. But it asks too many codes and makes it so complicated to log in to my own account. Now i cannot open my account. Stupid.
1,I am unable to login into my account ..I am stuck into verification page..I didn't receive code through sms and call Its been 4 days the timer is increasing every day ...help me to login into my account..I try WhatsApp contact support..still didnt solve this issue..my get OTP for other social media apps like Instagram Facebook telegram but in WhatsApp I didn't get OTP unable to login...help me
5,"Now, your latest update is fantastic. I'm using my secondary number to save some notes. This latest update gives you very useful features to chat with your own number to save notes and reminders. Thank you, WhatsApp! Now, you deserve a 5-star rating from my end üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü."
1,"When I put good quality videos and photos on status, then its quality decreases a lot. That's the problem otherwise its a nice app."
1,"VERY SLOW, TIME CONSUMING, STORAGE ISSUE, FORWARDING MESSAGES IS A NIGHTMARE. It's useage is limited gets hanged even with 256gb storage and 16gb Ram. Very pathetic performance. Transfer of data is also pathetic. Rest of the app runs so fast and smooth. Telegram is best camparison to WhatsApp."
4,Im struggling with my WhatsApp status when sharing and view other people's status it keeps jumping to next one! Plz could u fix this problem plz I'll be greatful! Thank you!
1,"Compare to telegram, Whatsapp is not doing good at all. You can't share videos more than 2:50 seconds. And it has limitations for the volume of the file you share. When you delete a massage it leaves a message. Pls fix these problems. These are really bothering me about Whatsapp."
3,My whatsapp account was hacked for the fourth term in this week alone. I'm really annoyed with all the two-step verification i did but it still got hacked. Whatsapp has no security anymore. You need to improve the security of this app
5,I love the app. But I'll really love it more if there's a feature that separates groups from contacts. Like there should be a bar for groups only like there is for community. Thank you
5,"In the latest update of WhatsApp, the emoji sections have been merged like what Telegram has done. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Previously, each emoji part was separate, but now they are listed one after the other; and this is not somehow user-friendly."
4,There is too much compression of file in WhatsApp that is not good thing even if we have to send a video without making document it will must loose its quality and even sending video status there is too much compression and if I could give it o stars rating I will give zero stars rating
4,Whatsapp has been a great app since its existence. But it would be very nice if the emojies on the android version can look exactly like it does on iPhone and telegram. The only thing I regret about changing to android is those ugly emojies
1,Have not been able to open or access app since.installation of update. Even tried on a different device but this also requires phone app access. Users should have the option to independently install app on their device.
4,"There is good except the sticker position, now it's makes me confused everytime i wanna use it, old version is better and pls add deactive acc like IG, ig that is helping when we need to go disappear for a moment."
3,"Hi, WhatsApp Messenger I'm using this app from 5 years and its too good app for chating, calling, and any another features. But one feature of this app is so bad which is ""delete form everyone"" option. When I deleted something using this option then another people easily understand that I send them something and after i deleted this. So please remove ""this message was deleted"" written feature after deleting something."
1,Worst app ever - why can't you save my message as a draft after I quit the app?? (or forced to quit because your scheduled backup always gets stuck!) And why can't I schedule messages it's 2023
4,"Some features in this new version of the app are not working in my phone, like some days, sometimes the files don't download. And sometimes Masange does not come for some days,etc So I request the team to solve this soon"
4,"This app is super great but I suggest you should include a saving option in stead of one downloading a status saver app. Please do something about it. The new update is a bit more boring, I miss the old WhatsApp üòû"
1,"after the recent updated version, I can't log in to my Whatsapp account, the only greeting page I see everyday I opened my Whatsapp, is you are using an old version, download the new version.. after updating the app, still, am still facing the same problem"
3,"I have a problem with this app, which is sending voice notes. When I send voice notes, it is sent without any voice. I don't know how to solve this issue."
1,"You made the emoji keyboard terrible, why not swipe left and right for the categories?! Please change it back, this isnt what we want.. The app wasnt bad, now its just irritating that it is not working right."
5,"WhatsApp facilitates communication between friends and family members who live in different countries and continents thanks to internet messaging and the later addition of voice and video calls. You can send audio recordings, images, and more to your friends and family using WhatsApp, even if you are miles apart."
2,"It's a good app have ever used but what stressed me is my account is blocked for no reasons and I now no longer have access to whatsupp and my lines can't be registered again,have tried following up contacting but still can see ways of restoring my accounts. So what Shld I do coz am confused."
3,A good app before the new update. I literally don't like this sticker and emoji option because it's not familiar. There are some bugs. Please fix it back to normal one.
5,"Hey WhatsApp team, I'm excited to share my thoughts on the newly introduced polling feature in WhatsApp. The addition of this feature has significantly enriched the way I interact within groups and chats. Creating polls is now a breeze, and I can gauge opinions and preferences with remarkable ease. Kudos to the development team for a job well done!!"
4,"Love the new updates, except where I can't view my status in list anymore. That I also have to delete one-by-one instead of having the option to delete multiple status at once."
1,I hate this app it sent me a message that it's going to give me 50GB but after sending the message to other's . My bar was full and it wanted me to verify it and it refused then it sent me a message saying that my account is not allowed to use WhatsApp now it's asking me to use another number . PLEASE DON'T download it . For now all of my chats are going to be gone now all that chatting for nothing üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüëéüëé‚ò†Ô∏è I thought that it was made to unite people not separate them this was my view
1,"Video call disappear while in a video call i tap back to chat. Instead of showing the video call. Is this because of new update,Then worst feature"
2,"There is so many issue in WhatsApp after the new update.Emoji,Sticker,Gif section are not aligning properly.Lots of bugs in this current update.Hoping that WhatsApp team will fix these issues as fast as possible.As a past 5 year I am using WhatsApp so I consider this app as my own app so I have some responsibilities on it so I am informing about this bugs.üåù"
1,Faulty and fraudulent app. Out of the blue I start getting international texts at noon time and the very next morning my account has been blocked. To add insult to injury the review was inconclusive.
4,"Very nice updates are coming that are fun to use.The UI has been much better from earlier but there's a problem,sometimes message does not get sent whereas my WIFI is great."
2,After latest update video and audio msg option button continuously switches between the two and I'm unable to hold audio msg button to record msgs Today I have not been able to send audio msgs after frustrating tries
1,"I am really getting frustrated by this app but the problem is it's very important for me to be able to communicate with my family and for my studies as we don't use other apps, I just don't get why they keep closing my account for no reason, I never write reviews I literally don't post anything on my status, I don't talk to anyone weird I only reply to my parents and read my studies in the groups, I don't understand what I'm doing wrong for them to keep shutting me out and they don't tell either"
5,So far the app has been doing wonder's. But I will like to suggest that WhatsApp should introduce options to Restrict calls and enable messaging only without blocking the person. Incase wishes to still received messages but call restrictions.
2,"Too many bugs after update. If emoji are used then screen turns blank or UI breaks. Please check if any openings for QAs, I am interested."
3,Everything thing is fine I liked the WhatsApp's new feature in which we can share images in its HD resolution but something similar should be done for the status as well.
4,Last update has lots of glitch when it comes to sending long message. The text box isn't working alright. And the emojies were arranged in a better it's much much worse now. Can i use the older version?
1,two colleagues want a data protection information from meta (developer) now both accounts are locked. Very dubios behaviour but a good reason to switch to a more reliable messaging app üëç
2,The app is good until the latest update.The update make the experience worse than never.If you want to see a group messages you want to go through the community of the group owner and select your groups one by one and see the messeages.The Achieve list will achieve until new messages come for an archived contact or a group.then why is there that option?
4,"I honestly believe that most of the complains by other reviewers must have been as a result of bad network. But as for me i am absolutely üíØ enjoying the app, it's been so amazingly intresting."
2,"For Christ sake what do you do when you get a message ""your safe mode is full"" so you can't use this app since it's not on the pH display/screen to be able to be seen and clicked on to be allowed to continue to use..how do we get more beta program space then?"
1,"This app is very lame. But ironically, it's the most popular messaging app, so I proclaim this is the worst messaging app. If it's not for my job reason, I wouldn't want to use this app anymore"
1,There's something up with my emoji keyboard when I want to use it on my status update. Only half of the keyboard shows. I now have to scroll through the nonexistent half before I can find more emojis.
1,WhatsApp Broadcast feature was maintaining poor quality message service. There is no other option for sending individual message for list of recipients.
3,Can't able to upload High resolution video as status. It compress the video into mb to kb in very low quality manner. That's a huge minus point. üòí
1,Hello Whatsapp team Sir I have also contacted my sim card provider company they have told me that no problem is being faced by the sim card provider company. Sir I am continuously trying to login my whatsapp account from last few days.I have filed my problem report on whatsapp help center many times to resolve my problem but i am still unable to login my whatsapp account.I am not receiving any verification code to login my WhatsApp account through WhatsApp. So you are requested to please solve.
5,"Is it possible to cancel the automatic transition between statuses? I think it would be much better, sometimes I don't care about all the statuses of my contacts."
4,Amazing app! Now I can speak with a gc and its amazing the only problem is when I tried to send a vid to a gc it wont work it just said this file format is not supported and idk what it meant by that so please fix it
4,Great deal of value and flexibility in all aspects including business and personal calls and messages .. no problem with this at all.. actually it's the greatest app ever made.
3,"Terrible since last update. What have they done to the emoji interface, it's become almost unuseable! So annoying, please change!"
3,call connecting problem Whenever I m trying to connect to anyone on watsapp call it's showing connecting everytime. Please fix this problem as soon as possible. Can any body help me out.
1,"A star bc. I downloaded some unofficial whatsapp and logged in some minutes later whatsapp blocked me and I filled a complain followed their procedures, with even that it took them 6 working days for them to unblock me, in the next 3 days after a hard time they block me again after I made sure to download an official status saver from play store, with this I have write several complain to whatsapp support for them to review my account up to date . I don't know whether it's today they will unbloc"
3,All total are good but I'm facing some problem about sending status . Like when I send my status then it will be show me that could not share this video please select another one ... Plz solve that thank you .....
3,Could you guys make view once has a time limit? Some a-hole has a second phone that they use to take picture. I'd be happy when there's an option for an image to be gone after 1s.
1,"Slow, buggy, stories won't load or play at all at times. Have to close whatsapp and reopen to try and get them to work."
1,"It is primeval technology, this is 2023 and it has no built in translate funcion, you have to cut n paste into a translation app. They could learn a lot from Wechat...."
1,This new Chat box Interface is the worst. People in devs are thinking they made a masterpiece update when they simply change the ui of a user friendly app. This is a headache. Stop messing around if you don't have any actual good update. STUPID META PEOPLE
1,Since many days my whatsapp login is not working registration is not happening *You need to use official WhatsApp to ragister this number * This is what I am getting written whenever I try to register. I am using official WhatsApp which I downloaded from Google Play Store. But still registration (log in) is not happening I also wrote to the help center on WhatsApp website but still I am not able to log in to WhatsApp. I have also emailed whatsapp support But still haven't found any solution
1,"This app force me to update ,but my phone didn't have storage üò°üò°üò°üò° because of this app i face many problems such as hang glitch etc the camera of this app was always hanging.So, please don't download this app if you will,then be ready to face the problems like me and moreover, after update i can't see anything new .üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°"
4,I can't see who is viewing my status. And also the blue tick is not coming. So we don't know who saw our messages. Please fix the problem. We will be pleaser . Thank you..
4,I just wish you can remove the option to save others stickers to our favourites because i made my own wasticker by drawing it on ibis paint and turn it into wasticker but my friends can put it on their favourites and use it instead so i just wish you all can remove that so they wont steal more stickers from me.
2,It's a very worst app. Whenever I'm talking on video call. It's getting reconnecting again and again. I'm not satisfied with this.
1,Recently I'm facing issues of sending stickers and mostly download issues...... I'm not able to watch the status of my people tooüòëüòë. New update is very bad literally very hard to find stickers n emojisüòíüòí
3,"I gave it 3 stars ,cause some times when u make video calls,the network does work,and the when someone posts a status ,i don't see it sometimes."
1,This new version is so frustrating and annoying.. Especially the emojis arrangement abd also it takes long for the emojis to display on the chat while typing. Please fix it
2,"The app lacking DND more, we need hide seen status, repost and saving. I'm thinking of where Instagram and Telegram will take over. Like Imo was an icon so place is never full."
1,Actually it is more than one month that my whatsapp is not working it shows past times and also it needs apdate but the new version is not in app store. Why??? If u can help please help me.
4,Its would be nice if whatsapp could make a new option during video call like sharing screen. sure share screen already include in video call. that would be nice to share screen with audio also. thank
1,"All previous chat deleted, i done temhe backup, total data is 7.9 gb, and when install in new phone option is shoe for restore 7.9 GB data and after start reatore some time later ia show failed and when reopen tha data shos 799 kb total, all chag and media not recoves in new phone m, kindly help."
1,You can't even identify if the register call is coming for your authentic app or moded one. All you did is introduced check making app unusable. Mail to support has automated reply only. Hire some humans to respond.
4,Give the feature to share images statuses and dp no loss of quality Give the hd quality option it helps a lot otherwise Better App But u want to add some extra features i.e. add an extra column like groups in the place of chats status and calls And give an option of who can call me ? etc............
5,Excellent! But one thing I want to suggest that the icon of ‚ÄúStarred Messages‚Äù should be in front of chat box on right of ‚ÄúVideo & Voice calling‚Äù icons by which we can easily access to ‚ÄúStarred Messages‚Äù.
3,I give it 3 stars for the following reasons: * It does not put the green dot in the chats that are online * It does not let you save the states. *Does not hide the phone number Otherwise everything is cool.
2,The new sticker and emoji view is aweful.. It looks so chaotic and it takes forever to find the right stickers and emojis Why did they have to change that? It's so messy and inconvenient
1,Wouldn't it be great if there was a group tab to easily access and manage all your groups you are in? We have community and channels yet still no group tab.
5,It is a very good application. HD resolution feature should be introduced image sharing in chats as well as sharing picturen on stauts ...
1,After Update I have Big Problem keyboard no Enter option Showing Send Key. Fast I am thinking maybe keyboard. Now I writing other apps or other location it is Okay. Only this problem showing in WhatsApp.
5,"This is very nice and any documents send is easily and one more good news WhatsApp new update is very good because video, photo and any documents send any people, neighbours, friends is high Quality photo send thank you so much WhatsApp üíñüòç"
1,This account is not allowed to use WhatsApp this type shows again and again it's really bad why it showes like that and change my number also and it shows like that I am e-mail to WhatsApp support that solution is not solved please say about us how to solve this problem plssss
5,"Good so far But will highly appreciate if Whatsapp can have a button at the status to save videos or photos in status, it will be very more comfortable please."
1,"Can't send or download videos, pics and voice msgs ...kindly fix this issue...it's happening for the 2nd time during last 10 days..."
3,"Sticker options now are getting worse. Keep putting me on Coffee-sticker instead of my history sticker that I really using everytime. Also, too much scrolling for stickers now instead of divide it like before"
1,I don't see the option of uploading high quality media. App acts differently on different phones.
3,Please check my app. I am automatic get out of app frequently. Must be some bug or its been hacked. I m facing this problem very very often. Please solve this as soon as possible.
1,The option of sending voice messages has gone and now it only lets you send video messages which sucks.
1,Link device to existing account is not working in any Android device. Personally tried in 5-6 devices !!! The QR code keeps buffering. Please solve it ASAP.
2,It forces us to update the app very annoying! If I don't update the app it doesn't show new messages and cannot open the app. Hate that
5,"It's an awesome app, if you want your privacy protected. I recommend it to anyone worried about their messages possibly being compromised"
3,"New update is pretty fun but sucks. Bugging all the time, sometimes I can't even see my own text. Please just fix it or bring back the old emoji settings"
1,"WhatsApp is not safe at all. My account got hacked and I am not able to login my account from last 4 days. Customer service is very pathetic, they don't have any solution."
1,I can't connect my Google Drive account to retrieve my chats into another device. It only allows me to sign in to another gmail which does not exist in my phone.
1,I don't get to see others people's status and if I post on my status after few minutes which is not even up to 24 hours I won't see my status again. And is really annoying on a more sincere note
3,"tbh i'm not liking it when i post a picture or a video, the quality goes üìâüìâ it really annoys me but overall nothing really bothers me , but still, i hope the person in charge can fix this problem soon"
5,"Lately now I loved this app so dearly,I really loved this new feature voice messaging/chat I made it easy for me to explain to my students easily during class. A big kudos to this app developer üëçüëçüëç"
4,"Please could you consider improving the Poll option to include 1) a date/time limit, 2) ability to extract poll results in excel format 3) the ability to send poll reminders and 4) the ability to close a poll."
5,"This ia a good app, by using this app ee can conversation with foreign people very easily. So, I would say this is very important platform. Thanks"
3,"I want a way where I can group my contact and whenever I make a status, I select the group of people to view it. Either my students, my clients or even family and friends."
5,"Can we have more pin options, we just have limitation of pinning 3 chat. It would be really nice if there is an update on this as number of groups is much more. Kindly take it seriously @ developer"
1,"Whatsapp is no longer working on other networks after the updates , it says verify you using an original WhatsApp and yet when you try to use the original, it doesn't verify again"
4,Please add flight mode feature. Some of us want to be offline while online at the same time. Great app it is
1,I am unable to get verification code (OTP) for login with my active mobile number. And active sim. Poor service. And not getting any solution from last 1 week.
2,My account when a picture is being sent or a video it does not go to my gallery I don't know whether is a setting or not cause I've not done any setting like that
1,"I don't like at all the new way WhatsApp is displaying status. I updated the app yesterday only to see that. If I had known, I would never update it"
2,"now it's can't read own recorded voice messages.... Incoming call buttons are not respondible. Interface reaction is inadequate. When you trying to respond the call the interface covers you all screen, so where you are trying to respond and this window May respond after five times... It's not able to edit messages. Deleting copy buttons hidden. the program is incomplete for user Only possible to use for voice calls. Annoying start end sounds in the voice messages, sync is messed"
1,Can the developers please put an option to hide the channels. It's really annoying and it doesn't look good
5,The channels are good but it should be placed as seperate panel but not under the status so it would be more convenient
4,It's very good app but there are many things to add in it please make it more good and helpful that we may connect with our friends family and etc and fix all problems .
3,There is a problem i am facing while i try to use voice record but my phone restarts itself . It was happend after the new update of WhatsApp
1,Such a stupid and unnecessary update. I would rather prefer to pay and use whatsapp as like before then using this new update. Please make one option to disable this new update because it is very annoying
4,WhatsApp has this glitch that it removes dp without permission or anything and on its own. Just happened to me. It's pretty annoying.
2,"This new feature is trash. We don't want updates, leave the status the way it is. Thank you."
2,It feels really pathetic to see the additional things added in status (updates) section.... Please try to change it or make a option available to remove it.....
1,I updated my WhatsApp app. But after being updated only call notification come instead of call. Sometimes it shows me offline.
4,Hello WhatsApp I m find bug on WhatsApp when I was send photos to my relatives photo was selected by then I try to use filters on image automatically send it no used filters this bug fix it my WhatsApp update already ....
2,Not as satisfying as expected compared to similar apps! I simply have it because the people I interact with use this app. Not happy!
1,There's no option to turn off the channels. I don't like that channel update in latest WhatsApp.
1,Just useless update now what are you doing just making WhatsApp as a Facebook kindly remove the channel options or remove this feature old one was very good.
2,Can we have 1 minute video status please. What is the point of an option to delete if there is an option to still view a deleted text or status?
5,I see many social media apps but this is the best app to giving secure & privacy to the users.I really love this app nd it give lot of other features tooüòç that's very useful to everyone.üôÇ
2,I'll give it only 2 stars because it has multiple glitches when you start to send messages. Message box go up and stick there
3,It's great but honestly I didn't see a reason why there is no option to set a custom wallpaper on WhatsApp web And also I wish they had an option to split videos that are longer than 30s when posting on our status automatically. Instead of having to manually do it
5,This app has always been doing well for me since. It has been very reliable and very clear in every aspect I might be dealing with. I recommend WhatsApp Messenger to anyone who might be in need of clarity and reliability when it comes to information delivery.
1,In this current world that everyone wants to post on their status this useless app crushes that by reducing the pictures quality. Why don't you go learn from other platforms. Very useless app
1,I am not able to reply anyone's status. While doing that the WhatsApp application keeps stopping. Please check this matter.
4,The recent update of showing Channels in Update is one of the worst. There should be option to disable.
1,"I don't like the new position of stickers, emojis and gifts. This latest update makes it slower to search for stickers"
4,Let us upload videos of longer than 30secs on our status. Also an option to download status posts of other people would be great.
2,Everything was nice until recently I faced a weird glitch. Whenever I want to send multiple photos in document format and even though I select all the pics which I want to send it sends only the first pic that I have selected cancelling all the rest of the pics. I don't know what's the issue but whatsapp doesn't allow me to send multiple photos in document format. Please kindly look into this issue asap !
4,"Awesome, but this new update that ydoesnt have the icon to search for contact is not making sense,and also not able to view your last post unless you start from the first post"
1,Whatsapp was doing good over the year until this recent update whatapp is now cloning telegram in so not good its not unique anymore its awful especially the status style its worse my only regret is updating the app please bring back the old status style üò≠üò≠
2,"One annoying periodic reoccurring insurgent behavior of this app is that: IT SUDDENLY REFUSES TO OPEN/ LAUNCH/ RUN, as I intend to get in. When I tap it, it just shows the white screen and green icon for about 5 seconds then bounces off, over and over. Data check is on. I restarted my phone at least 3 times, no way. Finally, am compelled and constrained to delete and reinstall the app, thereby, losing my chat history. I deactivated my auto save enablement because it filles up my memory space."
5,"This is an amazing app, its easy to use and it keeps you updated on new features or uncommonly known things inside the app. The voice and video call can be glitchy without a stable connection."
1,I redownloaded this app because it is giving me so much trouble.nonpop up notification or nothing at all unless you go to the app itself then uou will see the message so if you are relying on this app and your loved one life is in danger they are screwed because you never know when or if you got the message!!!
1,your channel function is bad. you can make other app for channl type work. you are provinding all featchers in one app. are you mad do you want to change whataapp into telegram.. üòè
4,"Updates are not getting faster to my version or to my system from what's app.....like, getting tapped into the new update of channels etc ...."
5,"I bought a New number form market I have no concern with its previous history.When I entered my number ""they said you are not using the official wattsapp go back and again log out""kindly solve my issue immediately. It's my humble request."
3,It is a very good app . But after the last update it started laging a bit and mostly if I minimise it to use other apps then it lags and the minimised screen starts flattering. This experience is making me feel uneasy to use it as it disturbs me a lot . Plzz look into this problem and fix it as soon as posible as otherwise it's a very good app to use . Hoping that the next update will come very soon and will fix this problem
1,New version everydays do a back up and take very long to complete...already disable that function but still remain the same thing so annoying
1,WhatsApp was once brilliant but now the features are so so so so so so so bad the status area was good but now it is horribleüò° and they change emojis area its so bad i hate the new feature eww eww eww ew.THE NEW FEATURES ARE JUST TRASH I WOULD NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER APPRECIATE EWWWWWWWWWW
4,Really loved this app until recently when it stopped automatically saving photos to gallery. Despite a number of queries still no solution and judging by queries on internet a lot of people are experiencing the same problem. Seems like Google aren't interested in fixing this problem or maybe they don't know how to because they aren't doing anything about it. But then again that's Google for you isn't it.
1,"It is rather good, but there are problems with it that bothered me a lot, which is that I cannot delete groups after I left them.Also, when I delete a message, it does not delete it completely, as it tells everyone that I deleted the message, and this is a very annoying thing."
4,"Love everything about it. But the new update where archive chats are on the top , that is the most irritating thing Please change it"
3,I have been using whattsapp for many years I like it very much.But now I am facing a problem with new update of video message.I touch the microphone icon but it does not change to video icon and I am unable to send video messages.Please tell me solution for this problem If the solution will work I will rate it with 5 stars.(insha'Allah)

1,Clarity of photos and videos is reduced when posting status on WhatsApp. Can it be fixed? ‚ùóÔ∏èCan you fix the quality issue while posting the status? The status goes without any quality.
2,"Ive used WhatsApp for almost a decade. Time length to send videos had randomly gotten shorter. My fianc√© and I always send video msgs throughout the day and he's had this same isse where our video times have gotten shorter. We would have plenty storage, but it's only allowing less than 2 min to record. I've restarted my phone too and no recent update needed. Idk what's goin on but it's annoying"
2,"How come after the new update I don't get to see the HD option, I mean I download every version but it's all useless is there some type of restrictions or something else"
3,"What's wrong with whatsapp's new feature? The viewed status are hidden, sooo inconvenient. The old version was better fr."

3,"My new phone (Redmi note 11) have an issue with video call where the quality of my camera just drop for no reason. On other apps everything is working fine, it's just I. WhatsApp where the camera quality is bad. Also when In video call the phone got a bit slower and hotter, even though it's just video call. Hope you can fix it if it is the apps problem and not the phone. Thanks"
1,I am using the official WhatsApp app but it keeps giving me error about unofficial app. I can register other account of my family member on the device without error. Similarly I am able to register my account on other device but not on my current device. Current device is running with Android 8.
4,Pop up notification is not available..why? And there is no update on Google Play store of WhatsApp to add new function like edit your chat..how to do it??
2,The emote interface is horrible. Its more complicated and sometimes does not even work..
1,App is great. But the image and video compression sucks because it drops the quality of anything you post. Please sort that out.
1,Deleting the app and downloading it again erases all previous data. This extra security is annoying for me. üí©
1,"For the past few months, I have always can't send out msg and I need to close it and wait for few minutes, sometimes is not working even after few times closing it. The worst is I can't find my broadcast list at the whatsapp Web, it is so frustrated."
1,Awful!!! Uninstalled my WhatsApp app and reinstalled it and when I try to edit my avatar the features kept loading and loading and after a while the app crashes. Terrible!
1,The data usage cost a lot before when it's not updating it's normal but now it's much worst . Hopefully you could fix this
4,Hi the app is good. Can you guys provide features for sending automatic message which should send on the time we want.

1,When are you guys going to sort out the below problem? It's been a year and 7 months already to be exact!!!! . . . New update yet no improvements to photo and video quality after posting a status. It's so sad that my friends and family does not get to see the pics I've taken on my S21 Ultra.
5,I don't want the Channels feature in WhatsApp. How do I turn it off ?  I want the old Status screen back. Plus it occupies too much space. Please suggest.
3,"After updating the app. The interface are separated from one another and it's making the app boring. Moving through chats, status and call is now stressful and boring. Where did our swipe go Mark? Please bring back the swipe to switch from status to call and chats back. Other than that. The new design is slick and nice. We need our swipes back though."
3,"Hello developer, As per latest update users can edit a chat message may be within 15 mins. Can possible to available same for status which remove automatically after 24 hours. Can you try to view last seen offline using number where users can view number as (you)."
5,Eversince I updated my Whatsapp to the latest version I've been facing glitches whenever I want to put an emoji on a written status. I was willing if you could help me anytime soon. Thank you
3,"It has been good all the years but now it's just misbehaving I can't get WhatsApp message popups,so I can't even know if they have sent me a message and when it comes to the call also it doesn't popup on the screen unless you open Whatsapp..so please try to fix this ..please üôèüôèüôè"
4,"It takes too much time in uploading status on WhatsApp and it is so irritating please increase the speed of uploading status and sending videos,files etc."
3,"HD image sending disappeared. Customisation is extremely limited, unlike telegram. 3 stars coz it's like a basic necessity in mobile nowadays."
1,"This new update is very tiring,exhausting and very stressful to navigate through.The older versions seem to be alot better than this"
5,I love it... The app is just wonderful and i get to share alot with family and friends both who are near and those who are miles away.
1,"What happened to this app. Used to work fine. Now All of a sudden, I don't get a verification code through SMS and when I try to do the phone call, I get a hang up as soon as I answer. So bottom line, I can't use the app anymore"
1,Whatsapp is not providing verification code. I am not able to activate my account. Please solve the issue as soon as possible.
2,I just hate whats app new feature update version please remove this update i want old version like status i dont need new chanel on whatsapp its a chatting app not a social media app why you add in different channel remove it quicküò°
3,"This app is great,but there is one problem, it always sends a message of updating. I updated whatsapp so many times and I lose all my chats,videos,pictures and my voice messages. When someone calls I answer but it is always shows reconnecting for no reason. please fix your app"
1,The fact that you can't have pop-up notifications after the Android latest version update is completely stupid .
5,"The app is very good. But can you add something like admins on a group will be able to mute someone on a group like the person will not leave the group he will still be on the group but he will not be able to send any messages or voice notes so he will just be watching the group sending messages soo it will be like punishment because I have this useless friend am not saying names, but his name is etochi please I really need to punish him soo I hope this message reaches you peacefully"
5,Please come up with the feature that separates the group chat from the people chats so as to make it more easier for use...aside from that the app is amazing
2,I didn't like the new version of WhatsApp. It's new feature making it complicated to use. It needs to be remain simple as it was
2,"Good because a bunch of people have it now and it usually operates smoothly... But omg is the customer support atrocious! Only option is to communicate via email and I swear I'm talking to an AI. The responses are so off-base and unhelpful. I got a new phone and # and didn't realize you could just change your # in your account and keep your convos. So tried doing that but am stuck in the setup on my new phone. I have restarted, hard stopped the app, and uninstalled it. No success and no support."
5,I love wp but it s super if you can add kinda to do list thing or check thing because I text myself about the routine and it would be great if something like that was exist
2,I've always had a good experience with WhatsApp but recently I've been trying to join video calls and it will hang up upon trying to join. I have a message coming up 'WhatsApp was closed because of a bug. Try updating this app afters it developer provides a fix for this error'
5,It's a best way to communicate with short msg services It's help us to not only to connect with our family and friends but also helps us to connect with our business associates. And it is reliable and safe way to communicate.end to end transcriptions.
1,"This app keep updating all the time but the status duration never get updated,I want at least the duration updated to 40sec! Or something else to update with the status things, YEA YEA KEEP UPDATING UR SYSTEM ARE SUCK"
4,"You are doing great, but while on data free reading,along the line,you suddenly call for data to be switched on. One is taking on awsres."
2,Announcement feature sucks ngl my nothing better to do cca mate loves to make announcement groups and I had to take a while before I knew how to archive the announcement chats if you at least hide the archive option at first tell us how to archive it through your status presentations instead
3,"Easy to figure out and use, the only problem I had with it was when I got sent a photo/video it did the automatic download, not just to see it, but it also downloaded in my system files for some reason? Overall it's a good app!"
1,Disappointed with new Channel option in WhatsApp. Please don't make WhatsApp like Instagram or Telegram. Keep it simple interface.
3,"Too many scammers on this app! Great app. Feedback‚Äî Messages from business, bots & websites require different page, backup occupies huge data quantity including media & multiple accounts same data. Scheduling messages needed. There should be a way to easily login to multiple accounts and easily switch accounts. Even it'll be better for the web version to work on mobile device browsers."
1,New update suck..who the F asking for this kind of update.. especially recommended channel..i dont want to follow any channel..and there is no option to hidden this feature
5,Please add a feature that can reject call or video call but not messages for unknown contacts or numbers that are not in the contact list. Very uncomfortable entering promotional messages from unknown contacts
1,"The new non-optional feature of showing the profile pictures of people in group chats, making a lot of valuable screenspace unused for such an unnecessary feature is very frustational. Hope to attract the dev's attention this way"
1,1) previously the GIF search result window size used to remain same once you start scrolling through it. Now the size reduces and its irritating. Revert this change. 2) The option to send photos with Best Quality doesn't work. Photos are still getting sent as low quality. 3) unable to create Avatar. The second screen after choosing skin color is all empty.
2,Each update keeps changing features it can be annoying at times... The option to mute the sound notifications but still show a chat's notification at the notification bar has completely gone. Now it's only completely muting notifications without the option for certain chats to appear on the notification panel without any sound... Please bring that feature back it was very helpful!!
1,"Voice notes aren't using my earphone mic, really frustrating as I want to be able to do things while I send a message to my boyfriend. Currently have to use Recorder app, then export to WhatsApp :/ really big oversight. Will update if this gets fixed"
2,"Each update comes as buggy. The communities, then the Channels now under ""updates ""... All useless. The emoji tab keeps laggingüëé"
1,"I'm hating the new makeover, I liked the traditional version better without the channels please give the option to change it back."
1,Hi. It's really a good App but after updating it . It causes problem in updates page it's not working
2,"I don't like the new features of channels below the status , it's annoying and give another page for channels not below the status"
2,"Alot of features hv to be released, like>>a separate page for groups and chats on Android>>sending to more than 15 persons at a time(instead of 5). And Whatsapp is too slow in releasing new features."
5,"My cellphone number is terminated from whatsapp, I don't really know what caused this but when I'm trying to log in with my details it says my account is not allowed to use whatsapp and it lasted for three days now."
1,"Why would I want to follow random celebrities in an app which I use to message people? Channels should stay in FB and Instagram. C'mon zuck, you're better than this."
1,"New feature is very frustrating, that in order to use emoji we need to pull the bar from the bottom, disappointing update"
5,"Well, been using WhatsApp for quite a while now and it definitely is the best in terms of quick delivery and the UI is just perfect"
5,I'm using this app for a long time and I can't get any type of glitch or something error in it. I think it's best to communicate with people
1,"It's constantly blocking my whatsApp account every evening, it works fine in the morning but again it goes back to same getting blocked and all in evening and eventually will get unblocked in morning after review.... It is disappointing to use it now.. Now I am fed up with it..."
1,Whatsapp is getting worse and worse. I have important drone footage to send. So I decided to do it via the Windows whatsapp. I try to send it and my computer froze. Ok it's just compressing. After a few min it is ready to send. So I wright my letter. When I send it it deleted my letter and says it can't send the drone footage. No explanation. No help. Just says no way.. I don't have time or space to review the terrible mobile app....
5,"Though the app is good and easy to use, I have a suggestion for a feature. Can you add the @everyone (Tag Everyone) feature in WhatsApp for group chats? It's a pretty handy feature will definitely bring ease in tagging all the people in a group for tagging everyone. You can also put an option in the group settings to enable/disable it. I'd really like you to consider this suggestion, thanks!"
1,The latest version have a segment named updates in which some unwanted links are present which are useless . This is the worst version
1,"Used to be great but now issues here and there. I have 2 issues I need your team to fix. 1. I can no longer send multiple documents, it selects just one and send. So inconvenient and slow. 2. When I play a video on status and leave, it keeps playing on the background. Please fix this issue."
5,This has been the best and the popular messaging app everything about it is perfect no snub you can also FaceTime around the world 5 out of 5 üíØ
5,"I am one of the 70s people , I go back a while in time . This product has clared the playing field . It has made talking to family and friends thrilling . Thank you for this app. .üíØüëç‚ù§Ô∏è"
2,Plss üôè remove the new version of the channel option on WhatsApp it's very irritating and annoying and pls apply the old version only it's 2 good and status option enable plss and plss disable the Channel and update version and all plss this version 2 bad for me plss remove that
4,When we sending high resolution video on status it's automatically decrease the quality..! Please solve this!
4,"When I send voicenotes instead of being sent they get deleted, it happened twice in one day and I had to restart my phone for them to work again"
3,The new update removed the search feature from status updates. Now you have to scroll till you find the contact's story you are looking for.
5,It's really very work full. But in this new update the status is totally blur when we upload our status. please check it
1,New Interface of emoji/gif/sticker box is horrible. Please put it back to the older version.
1,"Since past few days I am not able to send multiple documents at a time. I select multiple documents to share but when I send it, only one document is being sent. WhatsApp ruined its own user experience by the latest update! I would like to see a positive response from WhatsApp and I shall wait WhatsApp to fix this issue as soon as possible. Thank you."
1,This new updated version will hide permanently all ur muted status updates .. so before updating u hv to unmute all status updates otherwise u ll not able to see them anymore ... Ridiculous feature ..
3,"Good, except following disadvantages: 1. When u join a group, u cant see previous msg communicated in that group. 2. U cannot customise reactions that the group members can use. 3. When u change your device, u need to take a huge backup (including images, videos) which most of the times cannot be recovered by billions of users n you lose previous chats. 4. U cannot delete a msg from both devices anytime after sending it to a person. 5. U cant send a media file of 1 GB or more."
3,It was great but it can improve O send message I tap a contact like chats and if shows on my home screen but it did not for one of them
4,"Fainaly after two years i don't have complain, now i have, , I want an anti-virus and Virtex feature and every time a new number comes in, I can choose to open or block it without opening the chat , There are some system bugs for two verifications, it doesn't help at all it might not even appear even though I turn it on."
1,The newer updates have been ruining this app. Earlier I updated and a gray area started limiting my camera size in video calls with a gray line
4,"So nice but If there is this rule, it is better to divide it into two parts. There is one side for all groups and other side for personal chat"
1,"Channel update was unnecessary, if they can't stop the promotion of this kind of stuffs atleast they should provide an enable disable option for the people who are not interested in this kind of stuffs"
1,"It is a shame that you can't transfer all your chat history/media from an old to new device without using google backup that takes forever and if you have lots of videos they will not be backed up. It is a process that most people have to go every few years and is always a hassle. Everything goes smoothly, but whatsapp."
1,"Hey whatsapp team, my experience with your app was really good but now I'm experiencing problems and glitches in WhatsApp picture-in-picture. Whenever I am in a video call with some one and I try to minimise it, the icon glitches and blinks a lot and I can't even move it around until it stops blinking but it takes almost a minute to be functional the way it used to. Iam looking forward for this issue to be fixed and thank you!"
1,"Last time i had trouble on verifing my number whenever i added my phone number for verification it was rejecting I had to wait for more than 24hrs for whatsapp to verify my no, and i only used it for four days and since 25/8/2023 the problem come back whenever i try to add my phone number for verification it reject and telling me that i need the official whatsapp to use this account, I don't understand which official whatsapp do i need, and am depending on whatsapp for everything i do 4 living"
1,only reason i gave it a 1 bc i cant give it a 0. It can't send a sms message to my phone to verify then i have wait an hour before i try again. what is the wait BS for. this app sucks
1,"Please remove the new archive update , the previous one was better . Where all archive chats used to state archive and not pop up ."
4,"I don't like the way sticker and emoji packs display, the old version is better in that aspect.. And call times do not reflect immediately"
2,"After changing my phone to Doogee S100 I have this annoying bug. Using WhatsApp on loudspeaker locks the sound volume to 100% and the sound sliders don't work. I can set them to zero and the loudspeaker is still on 100% volume. Contacted support twice and both times my issue wasn't solved, bad service. Also the sound quality on loudspeaker is not good. I get some sound distortion and random cracking noise coming from the loudspeaker. This app used to be a lot better in the past."
1,Everything was good until this new uoadte of emoni interface it sucks lots of bugs in the emoji interface sometimes keyboard dissappears when using emoji and the way you have manipulated is not convinient. Please bring back old emoji interface or do something to fix this bugs
1,"So, I can't send messages, just get them. I asked for help, shared videos explaining the issue until they told me they were sorry they couldn't help me and the chat was closed. So they just decided to leave me high and dry..."
2,Now this app is very bad. Because when ads coming we're cancelleing. Even it's starting downloading ads games why. When we canceling the ads. It's starting download the ads
1,"Let us hide channels! No one wants to see a bunch of random d*ckheads, just want to see my friends statuses.."
1,"The screen goes green during whatsapp video call and I cannot see the person on the call,i have had this problem for 24 hours."
3,It's good but needs to be very good . Here I mean we need some features like not showing blue tick and that you viewed someone's status
1,"My messages are not being delivered on time, in case of emergency I can't send any pictures and it lags, glitches alot"
4,"Give edit option to the caption of the status even after it goes live, every time we have to delete the status just to change the caption if we forgot to write something"
3,"I used to love WhatsApp but nowadays I am uploading any photos on status gets blurry idk how to solve this issue, because of this I can't even put my photos on status"
1,stop this stupid channel features in new updates. Keep it clean. And reverse to simple status.
2,From yesterday videos are not sending to others and also videos are not sending on status. Please help me what i do please send me answers and solve my this problem
4,I just give four star because there is an some issues of this WhatsApp it was they suspended account without any notification if we don't know what we do wrong well please fix this problem and how we get back our account
4,"I love the app but there's something that needs to be added. You should add something like a ""read message counter"" so when you're in the situation where you may have several unread messages from a chat and/or group chat, you can enter, while scrolling, the amount of unread messages would be reducing. And when you don't have time to read all the messages you can leave the chat and come back anytime and the remaining messages would still be marked as unread. Please do this and you get 5 stars"
4,"Everything is good, easy to use and understand but You need to improve Story quality, when uploaded a photo or video, it get blurry,"
4,"After update I can't call to other, I think because my phone is 1GB and very low processor. Whatsapp if you can fix it then do it as early as possible. But this app is very essay to use and stay connected with others it has a lot of features."
3,Stop updating this app it's good for communicating and all but I can't even check my status updates with this new story thing you've added. Stop updating its longing my life out. Leave that to Snapchat
1,"My phone is gettin' slower because of it, i had to delete it several times due to the damage this version is causin'.."
1,I mostly prefer WhatsApp calls having board games or filters so people can actually enjoy whatsapp.i hope you get this feedback because I really want that feature added..I would really appreciate it if you added those features I just mentioned.thank you‚ù§Ô∏è‚úåüèΩ
1,For 4 days I am facing the issue of blocking account when I submit a review request it restores after 24 hours and again blocked even after 1 hour and I didn't even text or call some but it says you can't use account on this num
1,"I want to be able to look at my recent and favorote stickers first, please fix. Currently it sends me to the first ""folder"" of stickers"
1,The Encryption key and Password for backup Need Improvement . You can't access your data if u forget or lost the Key. Please improve this
3,"whatsapp notifications are not showing in the notification bar, ive checked all my phone settings & even restarted it too. PLS FIX IT, ITS ANNOYING"
1,"Doesn't install correctly. If I could give it no stars, I would. It simply does not work on my Samsung Galaxy S21 phone at all. It won't connect to the service when I try to log in. Support for this app is nearly non-existent, as well. I tried every remedial solution they suggested. I even sent them a video of the error, and they have no clue what to do."
3,"the app is nice and good...my few problems are, when u have a clear photo and u post it on your status or send to a friend the picture quality reduces so much that u can notice from a spot!... so work on it and again, try to apply font style on the settings. not only font size.. it'll make the app appear more beautiful and people will use more of it."
1,Frustrated. You can't figure out how to send the first message to a person whom you are trying to add as a contact period very amateur technology.
1,After a long time new update is coming with totally Understandable thing's. I have try to put my status from last 24 hours but it's not happen and also not deleted as well.
1,"What's wrong with it, I can't select 1 message to edit and can't tap and hold anything to share on bulk."
5,"Love the app, it's the best. But one caveat and that is having limits in sharing video content."
5,"Just the best app I've ever used consistently for years now, especially international and sending video and photos etc"
1,"Why your 2 camera option provide in updates ( Status), same function of both camera, please 1 camera remove & provide search üîç bar .no search üîç so particular person status search dificult."
2,"Hey can you pls give us the option of turning off that new channel option as for some people it's just unnecessary option, so that if we want to then we can turn it off too plss"
5,I love this app but it'll be wonderful if they had a recycling bin for deleted messages and a place where we could make our own theme
4,WhatsApp is very good but the reason why I rate it with 4stars is you Can not send larger files such as music non stops and movies to your friends üòü
1,Very Worst after update cant able to put status properly video can able to first 30 secs If we put trim and put in next also it showing cant able to upload
4,"It would be better if you can change the status views of contacts being opened one after other can be stopped. Because if I don't want to view certain contact's status, but after viewing the previous contact's status, it automatically opens the former ones, which I don't want to."
1,Please fix your photos and videos compression algorithm. It freaking compressed a 4K video to look like that if I have recorded it through a jellyfish. Have had these bad experiences in the past too but this one is just absurd.
4,Add one more update Like sometime we type wrong words by mistake. So add a feature by which we can edit our sent but unread messages. I miss such update a lot I got the update ...
1,"Archived messages are not muted now after the update. They're very annoying, plus are showing in the front chat dash board..."
3,Its good for texting friends but sometimes certain things won't send right like a picture posting very pixely or a voice clip cutting out but other than that it's a great app :)
1,"Bad video quality in status... Make an option for us to choose between low, normal or high quality when updating video status in whatsapp...."
4,It's really great full app I like this . I think one thing they should add in whtsapp is read deleted messages it will be really helpful
1,WHY FORCE TO UPDATE APP. Waiting for this message!!!! Never come back. Lost even my lab-top WhatsApp message is lost forever.
5,The recent update where you guys have added channels section. Please remove it. Please don't make it Instagram. It is WhatsApp and let it feel like that. Pleasseeeeeeüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
4,I think this Application is cool and amazing.Just that sometimes it terminates abruptly.It sometimes lags too However I am enjoying the new features.Kudos to the team.You are doing amazing
1,"I didn't like the new features channel, kindly remove it, worst experience, unwanted people are showing in my WhatsApp."
1,"I don't understand whasapp again. Number that have been using for years, whatsapp app thatbi downloaded from play store here is telling me that i need to get the official whatsapp app. Please how can i get a direct email of whataspp i need to message them. Thank you"
1,We don't like the new update of channels Please remove it. Because we want to see the status of our friends and this thing is not good
5,"Best app in the Play Store. Messege, Call anyone for absolutely free. Without any ad break. It's amazing."
3,"Why the resolution of video and photos become worst when it being upload in story, stop compressing it, just let in HD in story."
2,"Why does WhatsApp change the quality of videos and pictures when uploading on the status? Even after changing to ""best quality"" it still bad. Please fix it"
1,There is a current issue when my screen goes black and becomes unresponsive when i get a call or listen to a voice message. If the person on the other side hangs up the screen turns back on otherwise it remains unresponsive And sometimes when hearing a voice message the screen goes black and never turns back on. Please fix this issue.
1,"New update really annoying me with channels being introduced, Whatsapp was awesome as it was, now it's a bit irritating especially with muted statuses now being hidden"
1,Update makes sent ( forwarding)a messages and photos very slow. Its take too much time to search a reciepent name
2,we like the old version of WhatsApp more.... it's now more like Instagram.... please let the WhatsApp be simple like it used to be... Facebook ruining the simplicity pf WhatsApp.... for channels we have multiple options...plz let us have simple whatsapp
2,"This application can really spoil pictures with it's stupid compression algorithm. If you use an android device to send or post any photo or video in high resolution, the stupid algorithm completely obliterates the photo or video. Until you fix that, it's 2 stars for me"
3,"Please bring back our normal WhatsApp status without channels and all that, you can leave all that for Facebook and Instagram. We enjoy WhatsApp as simple and private as it used to be"
1,Since last update it is not backing up on Google account keep crashing and says it's bug there. Tried support but no help.
1,Channel update are not useful and it can be misused by children remove the updates instead try any other features or give options to hide channel update
1,"Re-installing chats is madly frustrating. First I'm told to enter my pin, then told my backups are not associated with a pin. Then it tells me about a 64bit key I didn't create. Neither did I know this was suddenly a thing. I've been backing up my chats with my Gmail for the longest time and I've never had to deal with this when reinstalling. After I tried to give whatsap permission to check my Google drive, It declares there's no backup even if it is CLEARLY THERE!! WHAT WENT WRONG WHATSAPP?"
1,Came here to drop this rate because of the channels feature. As if this app was not invasive enough.
1,Why did you mess up the emoji section? The new emoji section sucks big time... The old one was better by miles. Whoever designed it and the one who approved it should be sacked with immediate effect :/
5,So it was so fun to tax my people WhatsApp Antigua text basically and say stuff like a point important stuff or maybe yes for birthdays and stuff is the app that you need perfect to tax people that you need to text I had a lot of fun with itüëçüëçüëç‚ò∫Ô∏è
5,This app helped me a lot to contact my family because I'm too far from them and the voice note helps me hear their voice you should try it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü•∫
3,The new layout for the emojis does not satisfy me at all. Please bring back the old one.
3,"Why you can not silence the tone when sending messages????? üòî It was a good option, why change it???"
1,No longer supports Google Voice number. I don't have a phone number from a mobile carrier as I use data only plan with Google Voice. Whatsapp is unusable now. Uninstalled and got Signal app instead.
4,Please can you guys make someone aware of the fact that someone else is trying to infiltrate their accounts? Cos I have been banned multiple times and I'm currently not using whatsApp. Telegram normally alerts me whenever someone else tries to login into my account and they help me terminate the intruders progress so I just don't see the reason for whatsApp not adding this to their features. I think it will be very helpful especially against notorious hackers. Thank you.
3,"Ive been having issues downloading pictures, videos and even voice notes that are supposed to be automatically downloaded since this latest update. This is really frustrating. Please, if it can't be fixed, I'll like to know how if I can revert back to the previous update"
1,It failed to send a small MP4 video I recorded with my own camera. To fix it I was told to reset the app and lost all history and photos.... And still won't allow me to send the god-damn3d video
3,"Why is it that I can't view videos on my status,it keeps showing there was an error playing this video ,pls I need help"
1,"Instead of working on better privacy, you added pointless thing like channels. Nobody wants another tiktok or Instagram."
4,Nice to Message freely... And dont forget it's end to end Encrypted... Only We and The person who is talking will be able to talk private... Not even whatsApp can hear or listen to our voice msg and msg
5,"My user experience is good. My reservation is that as long as mobile data is on, Whatsapp will show you're online. I wish something can be done about this. Also, the daily local backup operation takes too much time."
1,Please do add saprate option for channels don't include it in status tab it's really irritating to use whatsapp please note not only me many people were facing this problem üò§üò§üò§
5,"I love using this app for chatting and calling. This app was convenient and easy to use, and I believe many people like it. Also, I love the support experience as they were able to fix my issue. THANK YOU!!üòçüëç"
3,I don't know... When i updated my second status... Freeze the video in 1t seconds... The next 15 seconds are not play that video... Why..?
5,"I would love to see separate rows for groups and broadcasts in the app. It would be so much easier to access my groups and broadcasts without having to search for them. Additionally, it would be great if we could pin our most frequently used groups and broadcasts for even faster access."
5,"WhatsApp is the best App am using for chatting but i would have loved an update, if I mistakenly uninstall my WhatsApp, files sent to me through will still stay in my phone storage. Thanks"
2,"Ihave 3 issues with the updates: 1. I want to have the initial option to store all data either in phone memory or *SD card* at centre location. 2. If you change mobile unbale to restore aal msg and data, if you have the backup. 3. Allow the feature to block call and international numbers in this app. Kindly resolve.."
3,It is good but it does have a problem . I can't see any download video media in my gallery or whatsapp camera site. When I got send video it'll be in the gallery media but when I request to someone to send me a video then it doesn't show the video in media .
5,I'm not able to login to my Whatsapp even after installing the official app. I tried reinstalling the app restarting my mobile many times but everytime the same problem arose It's saying that my number is not verifed and I need to download official whatsapp even though I was using official WhatsApp since beginning... Whatsapp is important for my everyday work... Hope you solve it soon.. Thank you!
1,New updates on the status are not good. Bring back the search feature for status it's so hard to scroll through to look for a specific person. PS. Nobody needs channels on whatsapp honestly.
5,"Loving this short video message feature! Can there be an option to have a default camera that it opens on, or opens on last used lens? It currently opens instantly on the face only and have to switch to back camera."
5,"Love it :video, photos, phonecalls/ video chat!!üí™üòâü§óüôè Update review August 2023... And when texting, don't forget to change or choose the language you are writing down... Because it's gone change automatically the word wrote and that system doesn't recognize ü§îü•¥üòâ"
3,Camera is not working while video calling. It is having access to camera and I can click pictures in chat through WhatsApp camera but in video call my video is showing as I have turned off the camera. I tried reinstalling it but still facing same issue. Help me resolve this issue.
2,"With the new update, another whatsapp named yowhatsapp got downloaded at my phone automatically. I logged in to that account keeping thought that it may be a latest version. But whatsapp blocked my main account for no reason and my data is not shown on either. What is the solution now?"
4,Can you give the automatic video splitter in WhatsApp status because it feels annoying to add video for 30 seconds and add again the same video from 31-60 seconds ü§¶üèª. I hope you understand the pain when video gets more lengthen than 30 seconds üò´.
5,"WhatsApp is Love. I love that it's every update is convenient. However, I would love to see an additional update in chatlock that it should also come with password or pin other than fingerprint bcz in my phone fingerprint lock doesn't work. 5 stars always."
1,What happened?!?? Out of the blue the app will no longer connect for both audio and video calls. I've tried everything that I can find online. Aggravating!
1,"Trimming of video in status is not possible. If we try to upload some video in status with trimming i.e. upload specific part anywhere from video of 30 seconds, it could not upload the video and shows error."
5,"Hello Team, I requested to you please add the gb whatsapp features, if they are able to create this type of features then why you can't, my last request to you all please add some types of features like hide chats, online pop-ups and sone type of features . this is very helpful for we, if we want to hide some types of chats then we can hide. and the online pop-ups feature is impressive we get the online pop up for friends or relatives when they cames suddenly on WhatsApp, please add this....."
1,Whatsapp is the good app But it has one problem .not saving messages while changing mobile you cannt get it back like telegram. It should be also like telegram you can easily get back your data in your new cell phone . If you could do this then it will be the best.
4,"Please I beg the developers of WhatsApp to come up with. Feature to lock chats And also Very important messages I had dissapeared Very important and I can't ask the person back for these messages So now I have lost those messages because of ""dissapearing messages"" Feature is not really necessary and I think it should be TURNED ON and not on automatically"
2,"App is continuously crashing and closing automatically not allowing to open it by any means, reinstalled the app,rebooted phone multiple times but nothing works, please kindly help getting this fixed urgently"
5,I like a lot because I can contact with my family of my country and it very easy to yours. A person that don't know English or any language there are instruction. I like a lot WhatsApp the best app for contact.
1,"Fix your status update quality!! I understand that files need to be compressed for it to be posted, but that is too much! You provide super low quality as if the video was taken by a calculator!"
4,"Very good app, but I'd really like to get in on the beta. Currently I prefer to use Telegram due to features available and also the availability of beta, which I often use and test on a lot of other apps."
3,"The new layout for sticker, emojis and GIFs isn't great. The layout takes a lot more time to open and it's annoying to use as it takes a lot more time to open the stickers I want to."
1,"This update is worst of all because The Ui is okay before this update after the update some part of whatsapp isn't fitting in my screen. The even on wifi the status upload quality droped as hell. I hate this app really each update its getting worst. Teligram is far more better. I am a editor i need max quality upload but No, whasapp want to compress 4k video to 144p. I don't want to send tham as doc. Learn something from Teligram. This app is very weak."
5,"That's good by the way whats app Edit : sorry for being cringe. Let me begin now, I believe that whatsapp is a good app but still it has minor updates that are required and one of them being the thing whatsapp introduced earlier but now removed. Guess what it is? The timer messages. Please add em quick and ASAP. Add a premium option where we rich guys can get some premium benefits."
3,"It now shows tiny profile pictures, which add no value. The respond with emoji has become harder and the emojis now scroll through the sections. Many regressions in a short time :("
1,"Archive files must be at the end of chats. I hate that feature. Also in video calls many scammers are making video recording and doing blackmailing business, so I think in video calls screen recording must be disabled to prevent safety."
5,It's best app for daily messaging and sending documents easily. The life without it could be very boring and tough. It had made our life more simpler.
2,"It's okay but more customisation is needed. I absolutely hate the colour of the bubbles in the chat, and should be able to change them."
2,Nice app but people who are not in our contact are able to sent us message so it's not safe because there are chances that it's some spam or some hackers so add a feature like if a person is trying to chat with you who is not From your contact then when the person who is not from our contact sents a message it gives us a notification that says - do you know this person.in this way we can click yes or no and decide who can get to chat with us with or without permission.so please add this feature
2,"It's an excellent app but something is wrong from the last update,the phone needs to get restarted before downloading any photo or video or viewing status. Please solve the problem."
4,"Emojis and stickers column views should be like previous. So that we can easily seperate stickers column wise. Here, on scrolling all stickers are comes in together while scrolling. So, please do it like earlier."
1,"Never auto updates even though I have it set to auto update, and the updates are so frequent, if I don't manually update, I don't get any notification when I receive calls.or messages. Making issues with people thinking I am ignoring them"
1,"Totally useless service you WhatsApp people, my WhatsApp account has been hacked since some day and I am getting logged out again and again and I had entered the 6 digit code for two step verification, it also says that it is incorrect and go to forget that code So I don't even get mail in my entered email id, what kind of service you guys have, I am facing a lot of trouble because of you guys and you guys don't even pay attention. There is no good response from the side, what kind of service"
4,"The app is a blessing, but now the issue of calls when u are on a call, a notification will pop up that a poor connection. It's annoying."
5,Its nice but the fact that achieved contacta are on top is not really doing some of us well as we will be wanting to hide those contacts but all on all its nice it would also be really nice if we could send as many documents as we want and any amount of data because the limite is 16mb which is currently not doing us all any justice
4,This is a must have app. But I'm starting to have concerns if the app really protects the user's data or not. They say everything is end to end encrypted but people like us really don't know the truth!!
1,Status Audio keeps playing even after i closed the app. Sometimes i just want to stop the music from playing and i close the app. But it doesn't stop the music.
4,"All the features of this is good but after update the issue is that when we turn off the last seen and online then i am not able to see other's last seen and online, please fix this bug so that when we turn off our last seen then we can see other's last seen and online. Thank you!"
5,"The ""Can't send empty message"" toast stays up too long. Also, is it really necessary? Why not just ignore the attempt? It is almost always accidental; easily triggered by sliding down screen edge. The message is still there too long. It has the feel of mansplaining. If you want to keep it, why not just precede it by ""Duh"" Make your feelings clear."
4,"From last two weeks I am facing problem for signing in. Every time message appears that ""YOU NEED THE OFFICIAL WHATSAPP TO USE THIS ACCOUNT"". As guidance available on website of WhatsApp I uninstall WhatsApp and installed again through link provided on website but same problem. I restore my phone as Factory Reset but all in vain, the proble is still there as usual. I cant use other number because I have only one. WhatsApp team is requested to please solve problem."
3,So many users seem to be having problems. I've been a WhatsApp user since (roughly) 2010. Its always done well. Five star rating for its past service. I tried to add a new contact recently and discovered the New Contact option is missing. I have New Group and New Community but no way to include a new contact. The invite friend option was only a weblink to download WhatsApp. Given my case and all the recent One star reviews for other glitches I hope the app returns to its glory soon.
3,"after latest update, during video call if the camera is turned off once, you can't turn it on again. Have to cut the call and do it again. So frustrating."
4,"I think is good to be able to edit already sent message, but the 15 minutes time out, I think it should be as long as the receiver has not watch the message, it should be able to be edited thanks"
5,"The best Data Saver messanger. Fast and efficient it makes so easy to share photos,video, and other files to friends. I'm happy with it all."
1,What a load of nonsense. Literally one whole day been trying to get it to work. Had no issues till the past few days back. Keep asking me to download the real whataspp real whatsapp. Been uninstalling and re-installing like mad n still nothing!!!!
4,"The app is crashing repeatedly after today's update. I have restarted the phone, freed up the memory, still the app is crashing."
3,I've been using this app for over 5 years years now and it worked great until the recent update... I've lost all my Data on this app and on top of that it won't even open... it keeps saying WhatsApp isn't responding please fix this soon or else I'll be really doomed
3,The latest updates were not good at all. Changing the sticker and emoji deck update made it complicated!üòè wish to see taking back that unwanted feature on next update.
1,"Numbers in phone contact cannot be sync with contact in whatsapp number ... profile picture have bugged, always disappear whenever refresh or change new one... please fix.. app kinda problem after latest update... getting lousy getting stupid... whats the problem? Lame app"
1,"Even a good phone is hanging on video calling.please improve it. If we make a video call to anyone, then the phone starts hanging, please check it and improve it thanks to video calling only. Lower quality video call"
5,"This app is very good, it's been helping me keep on close contact with people overseas... I do appreciate your contribution.. the one and only thing I like better from Viber is you can correct text messages even after you send them..."
3,In WhatsApp desktop version- bold option is not working since last 3 days. I make the words bold with asterisk but it not working. It just showing asterisk (*) sign in starting and ending of the words
4,"Well we're way past the saving of profile picturesüòÇ. This is a great app for communicating whether with your family or colleagues. The updates are top notch, never experienced any glitches or crashes."
1,VERY IMPORTANT COMPLAINT Where is my privacy while I am on audio call and simultaneously watching any video over the internet?? The audio of the video is also audible by the person on call. He/She can listen whatever i watch.
5,"I like the new interface but, I think new editing features, texts and picture transitions video/pictures will be nice in the next updated interface"
1,"It's awful üëéüèº always has bugs, the date of app is incorrect and some times showing future some times showing past!! And every MSG's are mess! And now kick me out of the app and I can't open it!! I hate what's app"
4,"After the new update, we can't send multiple documents at once. Please fix that problem. I think it's happening because we can caption the document before send it. Please fix it"
5,"This is very good app for connecting people individually and in groups but there should be an option for group admin to delete unwanted messages,,, ( one more thing that I want in this app is there should be an option to hide our chats not archives,,"
2,"Yes, everything is fine but you need to improve your privacy because if the phone is unlocked anyone can easily scan the whatsapp, you should if someone is using two step verification or end to end encrypte If someone wants to turn off Two-step verification And End to end Encrypt then ask for password again...And it would have been better if WhatsApp was screened off Then no one could easily hack whatsapp,,and send notification to someone's phone if someone hacked whatsapp"
5,"It seems that you have suddenly stopped STAR marking function for chats received.You have started this function for only business function,I.e only accounts of business holder's message are allowed.Also there is no any directly facilety to forword important messages to E Mail account or drive,please continue STAR marking facility again or give option to forword such message to e mail,in your app.Date. 20July 2023 As per my suggestion you have now provided ‚≠ê marking facility."
5,This app is good but it will be troubleing and many times and the message is sending but it is not showing in the chat if this is cleared then the app is 5star. I liked one thing in this app much and that is we can hide our last seen and when we aree in online that for whoo all we shold share that's is also tooo good and there aree many thems in this app so i would give the 5 star . But I will request the app that please ü•∫ clear my problem as soon as possible so please sir take a action on this
1,I'm unable to change my ringtone and notification tone. The only available options are the default sounds in my device and I cannot add any other sound other than that
2,My WhatsApp account has been blocked and if I try to log in to my account it is showing to use official what's app. I contacted what's app support team to resolve the issue. But I'm not getting any response from them. Please unblock my WhatsApp account. And respond to my mails.
5,The HD feature that lets users share videos in HD is amazing. It would be best to add that feature to status uploads as well so that users can upload videos onto their status in HD preferably..
5,"The very best.... Just a few advice on things the development team could work on for the next update. 1. pop up notifications ball for new messages(Contact messages not group chat). 2. Inbuilt 2player Games like Chess, Whot, Scrabble etc. Pls work on this üôè"
1,"Imagine being banned for having friendly conversations with one person. Nothijg ever violated the terms of service. This is an experience you can expect to happen using this app. It's overall features are great but the support sucks, and its detection system is far worse. There's probably people out thereactually being harmed that haven't been banned. DO NOT use this app!"
2,"The backup function doesn't seem to work automatically again, since over 2 months, clicking on the button manually, the ""please wait"" prompt also takes a year to load only to get cancelled by itself"
1,"I don't want whatsapp to ask about the quality of the conversation after the conversation, there should be an option that I'm not interested. That's why I ALWAYS leave very negative opinions about the quality of calls because it irritates me even when the quality of calls is perfect."
5,Please improve the images quality to the highest one. Most people don't mind wasting some of their storage spaces to get the best images or video quality. I hope you can consider this. Thank you.
5,It was a very helpful and useful app for me. I like it too much but now a days it's creating problems a lot and taking a long time to open. It will be better if there will be a reset facility to update the app.
5,It's fun and useful. You don't need any mobile credit (the stuff you need to text or call somebody in another country) and is completely free; no ads either.
4,Extremely excellent... BUT!... when i go use the emojis sometimes i click as i used to on a certain emoji then i realize that i have sent a sticker... sending stickers needs another sending confirmation step please... thank you (I may loose friends and jobs because of this...)
1,"This app is literally not working at all Every time I'm downloading it's literally showing you need official watsapp to use this account!!!!!! Highly disappointed.There is error in phone number verification.please solve my problem,,what's app is very important for my daily works."
1,"Hello, 10 - 15 members of my contacts are unable to view my status, All settings are correct even though they are not getting my status, It's been a month since I'm facing this issue, I complainted already on WhatsApp support but no proper response."
3,I gave only one star bcoz of some bugs are found in last update. Video calls are ended automatically due to microphone problem. But i checked it's clearly works in normal calls. Please fix it
4,"Feature request : Please add reaction update time for a message. In groups, there is a count of people yet to read the message. Similarly show the count of people who already read the message !!"
2,"there is something bug in newest update. when sent photo to others, the photo also keep on gallery eventhought it had sett off at media chat - visibility and storage-data...please make sure that bug....tq"
5,"Very good app to use. But, since 3 days I am unable to open it. It shows, ""you are not using Official app"", while I am using it in same mobile since 4/5 years. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it also."
2,very poor performance. i couldnt send a pic. in other app idnt hve this problm. latest version work bad experience. to send a pic or video or messages anything taking more time than other app
1,"With the latest update, the app keeps crashing Everytime I open it.....I can't view status anymore and I can't text anymore as it keeps hanging and crashing or closing up"
1,Make a new update of no calling option or disable calling permanently. These days scammers generally do WhatsApp call with a fake profile and picture & truecaller also can't detect it. I only want is messaging option.
5,"it's a really good app, many peoples are using this app. This app is helps us to communicate in all ways,like video call, whats app call, chatting etc..... There is even option for sending money. Everyone need an useful app like this. All the updates of this app is also good. And l am using whatsapp for many and l never had any problem with this app. Everything is pretty good in this app. Everyone should try this app, because it is a wonderful app. Enjoy your day by communicating with this app.."
1,Ive been reaching out for daysss trying to get my whatsapp back up i downloaded the official one as requessted and still havent been able to get bck onto my account can someone help me fix this been trying but no one is reaching out... can whatsapp contavt me through my email and send me a code that i could bypass the sms verification its really frustrating tryin to do this....why is whatsapp sayin they will contact u in a certain amoubt of time and u wait and then THEY DONT DO IT SERIOUSLY!!
1,The image and video quality when uploaded in status should be increased.... It turns down the quality of images and videos so low it feel disgusting to post..... We can't even post 4.2 mb video .. they turn it into more low quality
2,New update is awful. Whenever I try to upload a video in the status it starts to hang and glitch.. Sensitivity is Much slower than the previous update.
5,"This has been a really useful app for me to say use for the very first time as I had no idea of what it was until I got told about it by my work colleagues so we use it for say keeping in contact with my work colleagues and other members of my team that I work with, plus I also say use it for say keeping in contact with my family from down south as we don't get to see each other that much at all so it's the best way keep in contact. But over all I love this app so very much I do and keep with it"
5,This app is so easy to handle and very helpful that one can connect to near ones wherever they are both nationally and internationally. May God bless the handlers.
1,The recent update is seriously irritating. The emoji box takes too much place. And when I try to tag a previous message by right swiping the keyboard doesn't open on its own üòëüòë
3,"I'm still trying to understand why when we post on our stories on whatsapp, it reduces the quality of the video. It really doesn't make sense. I hope you guys can fix this both on ios and android smartphones"
1,Previously status below 16 mb was uploaded without app compression now even the file size is less than 16 mb whtsapp is compressing the status file quality. This result in uploading of videos in very poor quality. Please check this isue.
3,"After updating the app, emoji and keyboard is not good. Before updating, keyboard directly comes after sliding a message now we have to click again to open the keyboard emoji section has also changed I want the old features"
5,This is my favorite app for contacting. Without any advertising I can talk very clearly with my friends/relatives. This is really really really too good. But Whatsapp should have their own server but still they are using our gmail for storing chat history etc.
5,"WhatsApp services are no doubt second to non but, the frustrating thing in its usage is lack of practical demonsttration/summerised form on rules of usage for both old and new users especially when a telephone line is recovered from a hawcker. My humble self, has been trying to get back to my WhatsApp line for some time now. WhatsApp services is a cutting edge Brand . Tnx. Am yet to recover my whatsApp number."
4,"WhatsApp has been crashing on my Samsung J phone - 3 times in the past week. Twice this week, I navigated to the app and my phone screen went blank. Please fix this bug."
1,"WhatsApp Locked ""Something went wrong try again"". Every time, since the fingerprint reader stopped recognising me. Disabled fingerprint reader, forced stop, still shows that message."
3,"Dear developers There is a glitch in this new update please fix that. Whenever i click on status it is blur for no reason. after few minutes I can see it, but later on it's get blur again and again. I hope you guys fix it soon in new update."
3,"There is a bug in your app. When you open the app you can see the text Chats, status getting bold and then comes back to normal."
3,There's something odd happening in the picture in picture mode. In this past couple months There's a lot of glitches during video calls
1,"Pathetic. Everytime I am switching phones, lot of data getting lost. The backup is not restoring all. Transfer chats not at all working. Very huge disappointment for a person like me who rely on WhatsApp for many of my work."
2,Runs all the time drains battery it is owned by Facebook . I liked the old owner he had no spyware. Decided to see if it was change yet. Text one time no problem.
2,"Its unfortunate that i can no more view videos on my CL status again. The videos uploaded aren't showing, it on playing an audio version underground."
1,"The latest update of Keyboard, sticker, emoji and all that is very much inconvenient and difficult to use. It needs an easier update or change immediately."
3,This app is though very essential now days but Its very wrong that the ACCOUNTS ARE BLOCKED WITHOUT KNOWING THE EXACT REASON FOR BLICKING. This is causing hardship to the account holder. Must look into it and provide helpline Number to reinstated and access the locked account
2,"App is great but reason for 2 stars is compression of photos which makes them blurry...and group tab is not separate from chats which causes to miss some important chats as frequent messages in groups brought them up and chats go down...Please make separate tab for groups as for calls, status...Then it will definitely a 5 star application."
2,"After uploading photos and videos to status, clarity of photos and videos is gone. What's aap really needs to work on this thing."
4,New version of imoji/sticker display is so annoying. I prefer the old structure. It's simple. This is not.
3,Great app. Enjoying it in kenya. Meru kwa watu wa veve. Kindly add the copy feature of multiple messages without including the sender details. Just plain text
2,"I don't know what happening to your app that's start with a shiit , each time I post a photo or a video , the resolution of decreased, its flu on every photo , image , video its flu on my status could you fix that"
1,I can not do voice and video calls. Just says connecting. Tried informing WhatsApp. They just tell me they are escelating it. Never hear anything back. Don't download if you need voice and video calls.
4,Very improved now but it is annoying how the statuses face network problems and i hate that it has the profile photo view together with the status view option. I just want to see the profile photo not the statusüôÑ
2,I am not happy with WhatsApp. What is the essence of back up if you can't recover lost chats and photos since you have to back up. It really doesn't make sense. I lost my old WhatsApp mistakenly and can't get back after trying so many things
1,"Audio not sending on Video clips now for weeks for me, wasn't a problem until update a while back. Have done all the checks and even tried on a different phone, same issue. Please fix"
5,Hi this app has been helping us with a lot of thing.let me give you an example.when you forgot something at your friends place you can text your friend and ask her/him to tell her/him to bring it when she/he comes to visit. BIG SHOUT OUT TO WHATSAPPPPPPP!THANK YOU AND BYE! Please reply to me
1,"The developers of this app have lost it totally. The system keeps banning my accounts and asking me to install official whatsapp, as if am using a third party application. An app I downloaded from Google Play Store. Your system is corrupt and should be fixed, so you stop harassing us with using fake whatsapp."
3,"This latest update is awful, disappointing, takes the app back many generations. The previous updates had allowed heavier document sharing, now this has return back to the days of not more than 16mb, awwww! Disgusting!!üò†"
5,I need to stop receiving notifications from the groups i have joined. I have mute them for a year and archived them but still they came pn top of the list when someone message within the group. I need to have a feature in which i don't get any notifications from the groups that i have archived.
2,"I can't download media files (pictures, audio, files) and it's annoying cause I really need the, so don't know the problem, but hope for it to be fixed"
1,The app is great but after you have done. Backup I cluding pictures and videos and you try to reinstall Whatsapp again and you try to download back the pictures and videos it's not working
2,The status thing is forced upon us. It makes the app so much more horrible in its use. I know facebook took over but this app should have functionality over what facebook wants with its social bullcrap. 2023/08/15 Plz remove the status thing 1 person in my list started to use it and it is so pointless. It realy decreased my satisfaction of a good working app. Plz zuck not everything need a status.
1,Im using Samsung S21plus and it says that pop notifications is not available on the andriod version.. Eversince the last update. Im having a hard time getting notify and it's only one tick on to those who send me msges. I cant get any calls too..
3,"When I playing games, mostly the WhatsApp Call got Cut Off out of nowhere. It's not suddenly cut off, but after a few minutes. Please Fix it, i don't know what's the problem."
1,The recent update really sucks. My keyboard is not coming automatically when I select the message to rply back. The sticker section is also creating more headache.
2,"The app is overall good but when I put video on jy status and trim any part it doesn't go properly, after being uploaded it lags and eventually pauses after some seconds,pls resolve this issue"
1,"In the new update only fingerprint is available for locking the chat but not everyone have a fingerprint type mobile without fingerprint we can't set passcode also ,and it is working when fingerprint is available otherwise passcode not working and add hide call history for locked chats and add chat hiding instead of archive so that we protect the important chat other than this nice app"
1,The app reduces the pictures and videos quality a lot which is so bad. An iphone to Android transfer of pictures and videos on Whatsapp is so cringe because the quality of the images will reduce immensely which is so bad. Please enhance the app more of this!
2,Pleas don't do anything to sticker tray. It is very annoying now to click at the bottom of the screen. Please change it back to old design.
4,"I think, if groups and contacts have different chat factors, it would be more convenient. I have so many group chats, so some times........ I think,it would become really great messenger if it has different coloums for contacts and group's, please be considerate"
4,"1) When we archive chats, and from setting when we choose to keep them archive after that domt show it on top it irritattes. Show also the online status(if online) of the person with whom we havenot done any chat. 2) Whenever we reply to any video status it keeps playing in background kindly change it to automatically mute or dont play it"
1,"I have been trying to verify my number for days. I have unlocked the security on my phone. I have gotten text messages saying ""I can now request a new code"" NOTHING. I have tried the call me option. It locks me out because of to many attempts. My kids are in Peru, this is the app they choose to use. It's very upsetting."
1,"You want to add some channels cool but why you want to force it exactly where the other status are?, that's ridiculous actually, how about give as the option to add channels without those very bad suggestions that i have to see every time i go there or put a settings that i can remove them oh my God"
5,"Amazing app, so easy to use and customisable. Have tried it several other messaging platforms and whattsapp stands out as the best option. Really happy with it."
4,"Hi, wp team. Everything is so good in this aap. But i just want to you please increase the video duration time 30sec.. To 60sec.. In status mode. And dont decrease the quality (photos and videos). Thank you."
1,I hate Whatsapp logging moment. It doesn't work very well. Also there has a problem about sharing location. We couldn't see my own location in google map...
1,I would like to inform you. When I trying to log in your official whatsap application it isn't not their official version of the app. You should have to install the official app. Please fix this issue it's so frustrating.
1,I was started used this app is good to working but know a days is not good working because I'm faced many problems in this app I request many times to the support they don't solved what I faced last one week one notification is showing my display what is that you what's number is ban that time also special request to the WhatsApp team but they solved in three ways of ban cleared but after clearing my open it then also not working please solve my issue as early as possible I'm clearly mentioned..
4,"More chats should be pinned not only 3 upto 6 chats should be pinned ,very dissapointed and before few months a new update came in which when we close the picture and go back to chat the picture goes up, I don't have words how to explain it looks very bad.But I only need update that more chats should be pinned this is must."
1,Never had an issue but since latest update the app instantly crashes. I'm on a pretty beefy phone so that's not the issue. Fix this bug please - one plus 9 Android 13
1,"I think my WhatsApp account got hacked by someone.I want to report this issue regarding my WhatsApp bio's Year, date and month. It is showing the date,month and year as 1970 January 20th. It's not added by me. We all know that at that time there is no one found the WhatsApp. Moreover there were no other kinds of internet felicitates were introduced to this world. You should fix it in a proper way. otherwise I'll install it!!!"
1,"Horrible, terrible app. My account was blocked for literally no reason at all, and I was not able to recover any chats. No way to contact support directly and no way to view my past chats. Avoid this app like the plague"

3,One of the best socail communication apps ever. But the reason for 3stars it doesn't pick up all my media I checked app permission and try uninstall and install still doesn't pick up all my media
1,"When sending a video, the app decrease the quality very much, hope you solve this problem, at least make the videos quality HD 1080p. I will use other massenger apps if it not solved"
1,"They don't seem to do a very good job of filtering out spam. They seem more interested in pushing useless ""features"" like stickers. I just want to talk to my friends :/"
1,if i can fill it with 0 stars i'll gladly do it. the UI looks straight like trash especially when you're about to send stickers & GIFs. Wow! great job Mark! can u do worse than this? make it miserably worse and worse.
3,I am experiencing significant degradation in video quality when uploading videos to WhatsApp status. It would be greatly appreciated if an option could be introduced to allow users to select the desired video quality for WhatsApp status uploads.
4,"I use this app for 2 years since I have mobile but last day whenever I opened it it shows error that""Whatsapp keeps stopping"" Although my other account was working perfectly but it shows error.My request to developer is to fix this problem."
1,"This app is an actual joke by now. I received a notification to read pinned messages and it asks me to update. I did update and the messages still didn't show up. What a joke, thank god Telegram exists."
1,"17th July 2023. You have added an additional permission ""New: read location from your media collection"". Why did you not mention it in the ""What's New"" section and why have you added it! Are you attemting to obtain the location of your users who have denied you location access via Android permission???"
2,I can't seem to post videos on my status anymore. It always has the same error message saying I can't post that video and I should select another one. What the heck is that?????
4,Am having issues updating to the latest version and when I try to do that it's says unable to download and I see pinned messages on my group which is so annoying üòí.... you guys should do something about this please...
1,"After updating the whatsapp Yesterday, My whatsapp is not working. I can send messages to other they can even see it, but I can't see their messages or double tick. Help !"

3,"It was all good but now when you're replying to someone's chat,it doesn't automatically bring the keyboard,you have to swipe up to type. Fix this . It's really annoying"
2,"Too many unknown numbers can cause scammers to make use of idle phone numbers which they use 1 time or for particular scam only. Is there any settings to block these unknown numbers to cut communications so that to avoid any further communication? If there is, hope to know where can we get the function."

3,"After the recent update, I feel mad about the smiley, sticker area. If I took 5 seconds to write something, then it will take 10+ seconds to identify how I could add a single smiley or sticker. Such a pathetic and unwanted layout change. Please revert it."

5,Overall this apps is very usefull for human being. One thing that made me annoying after last update second account can't be archieved. Pse fix it. I need the feature. Thank you so much
5,Outsanding app .! Suggestion (01) There should be a facility in the app that who has added a number to the group or who has made a certain person an admin. (02) No admin should have the right to add or remove any one no more than 10 times.

1,"It periodically removes some numbers that I saved and my profile picture. If I click to ""see contact in the contact list"" it doesn't work."

5,whatsapp features are getting better and better but on the last update the feature of popping up the keyboard directly when we do reply tag the message is gone. can the developer return it back? thank you. so sorry i use review as i dunno where should i go to tell this. but whatsapp as of now is the best messenger. great work!
4,Give us an option for hide phone number for every one. While choosing attachment please open the default gallery app of the device instead of opening WhatsApps own gallery app and while choosing camera open default camera app of the device. Instead of whatsapp own camera Remove send money from textbar. Lat us allowed to choose our own custom accent color.
1,The feature for sending hd quality video and pictures is not available on my phone though it is running on Android 11. Please fix this issue.
1,"Very bad experience, her dp is not visible also when I text only single tick appears. It's been several months, whatsApp still haven't fixed this bug."

1,y does my whatsapp doesnt have the screen sharing feature when its already the latest version?even my phone have the latest operating system but still doesnt get this screen sharing feature?fix it ok.
1,"I can't sign in to my account it show that ""you need the official whatsApp to use this account"". I am sure I don't have any unofficial version of whatsApp but still I am facing this problem. I also mailed whatsApp support by I didn't get supportive response from whatsApp support."
1,Many bugs with new smiley keyboard layout. Please fix it. Freezing temporarily most of the time after posting with smiley. Also not restoring chat screen state to full screen after post message.
1,"I had a account and it was okay then. For the past few days I have been trying to verify my number but the verification code, sms, call are not coming. I have tried many options but nothing is working."
1,The new emoji feature is a no for me.. Its expanding unnecesarily.. Covering the entire screen. At some point you cant even see the emoji that i'm pressing... Its frustrating and slowing me down.. It is a no...
4,Maybe you should make this app restrict who ppl who don't want their phone num gets share from their friend. Its a big help for me. Also can you make a share screen mode?. That also helpful for me.. or stream(live) features.. both of them gonna be soo helpful for me.
3,My whatsapp account is not working even after 8 days please tell me what is the process all my work has been stopped so it is telling me that it has been deleted for some reason and it is saying download again but still it is not working I have mailed repeatedly but I am not getting any help all my contacts have been lost due to whattup is closed and I am not able to do any of my work please activate the account as soon as possible. I am mailing you but no one is replying to me please give me
3,"One issue is identifying the exact date of previous messages. It only states the day of message and not the date, causing hassle in tracing.."

5,Its an amazing app for chatting and calling family and friends ‚ù§Ô∏è I've been using it for years and I s love it. The updates are to die for ü§§ I really love the app keep up the good work But can you make it to work without internet connection pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏èü§™
1,I think that there should be an option to block unknown numbers. Messages from unknown numbers can cause disturbance...... I think that what's app status should have features similar to instagram story.....
2,It is a very useful app nice oneüíìüíñüåπ.But the picture quality is not that much nice.It's a useful app but the picture quality of video call lacks.So I request that please pay some attention towards it.Only becaise of this video call picture quality .I gave 2 stars. If it was nice I would give 5 stars
4,This is an amazing app. But the reason i am giving 4 stars is that i am not able to utilise the Chat Lock feature which has came into the recent update. Request the developer team to kindly look into the problem
3,The App is very good and easy to use but the only problem am having is that when I make voice record my voice will be very fast I really don't know how to solve the problem because it not making me to enjoy the App the way I should...
5,"So far so good but, whenever I reply a message from the pop-up, the message is sent however on the pop-up it shows its still load waiting to be sent. Can you resolve this bug?"
1,"Very stupid update, now my sticker packs load so slow. And the stickers sent in chat will only appear after few seconds. I dont understand why you wanna change the interface, it's so unfriendly now."
1,"I do use whatsApp messenger, but lately it has not been working. Each time i open the app, register my number they keep on telling me i do not use the right one, whereas it is this whatsapp i am using....this issie has been stressing me up lately, as i am not able to reach out to anyone"
1,It's been a great app.. Lately I became a disaster to the phone . Always heating the device upon launching.. alot of hangs.. disturbed setting changes ..
1,In this update version.. My imojis and sticker bar got stuck.. It is not working at some time... Please make sure it is not a bug... I am completely irritated with thiss üò¢
4,"Great app, have been using it for years. The only feature that I really want is the option to add a dedicated tab for groups."
3,From recent updates I'm facing issue in voice recording. WhatsApp voice recorder sometimes don't work. Also WhatsApp sometimes crash itself all of sudden.
1,"For a long time my whatsapp is not forwarding while sharing photo or other content in other account or group, I have contacted whatsapp management many times but they are unable to solve my problem. Please fix this issue."
4,"Been wonderful since its existence, tho when I updated to the latest version statistics upload for pictures and video quality is so so low. Please do something about it, it will really help."
3,Video upload quality is missing. what's the use of using expensive phone with a good camera quality while posting video on status quality is bad. Hope to see good video quality on status in the next update.
1,Watsapp web not working properly..... Has a lot of bugs.....(like if i send a pic. To myshelf.... Then it does not show in my computer..... But it shows in my mobile...... And we also need a scheduled message type of thing to send messages at a particular time.....
1,"the new design sucks , so deficult to manage and use ...and for the millionth time we want to be able to send high quality pics ... it would be really nice if we can categorize our chats (primary & general) that would make such huge defferenc to be focused in our lives and jobs .....and if you could delete the notification (this massege was deleted) when I delete a massege ,I have the right to not be investigated by the athor end of the chat when deleting a messege"
3,"Could u pls make option in setting, tht we can hide our DP from some saved contacts like u hv made in status privacy setting. Status in WhatsApp should have a like icon as in Instagram we have, so that someone sees our status they can hit the like button instead of replying for a status."
1,Can't you make us to upload status in high quality please make changes on status section that would be great if you can let us choose the option of quality while uploading status I know there is High quality setting but still the quality is very low the video is not that clear
1,"Can't change to forward camera following july android update on pixel 7a. Each time I try it freezes, when reverting back to forward camera the app crashes."
1,"When making a video call the screen defaults the landscape rather than portrait as it was before, I've uninstalled and reinstalled it and still doesn't revert to original settings"
1,"My account has been refusing to work since when I wanted to login, right now it's saying account cannot login, I should re-register even when I do so, it didn't worked. Please help."
4,"Nice app to make a conversations.But we want some more features like G.B whatsapp like a separate page for CHATS & GROUPS .That's amazing feature We want that in this app .Please try to make it possible Brooo, Please try to make a separate page for chats & groups .It's too useful for usss"
3,"I wish we could be able to see what someone's playing on their WhatsApp pages,i think it would be a lovely design atleast one can also enjoy it too and able to download or streamline the songs."
5,It's all good..But I just have one earnest request to the developer.. Please make the very old media files to be downloaded..It is a very important and needy demand of most of the users..Thanks you in advance..üòä
1,"Latest bug: even after the call is done, the call doesn't get disconnected & on the notification drawer you see the call time being calculating the duration of call as active Telegram is best, if whatsapp is still adamant on group limit. Group limits should be removed. It's time for whatsapp to LEARN FROM TELEGRAM. 1024 is no good. Make it 10K. Your customer base has shifted drastically over the couple of years."
3,Actually i would be thankful if they add a logout option it would be very great to be able to log out while your information and everything stays saved And for the tag option on group it would be helpful if tag everyone would be added it's less annoying to tag Evey person onthe group.
4,This is a great app. But I gave it a 4 because my account is constantly getting banned temporarily without any accurate reason. It shows I installed the unofficial Whatsapp app but I did not. Fix It
2,Works reasonably most of the time. But sometimes messages don't make it or like today linking with the webapp version fails all the time. Just use something decent like signal.
4,"Lately, lots of the time I get the notification that I might have some received messages. Usually, after 10 minutes I get the message that was indeed sent to me 10 minutes ago. I don't know why this happens."
1,"having issues with audio messages , some doesn't get sent , some says it can't be sent because it doesn't exist in my storage."
5,"WhatsApp is a freeware, cross-platform, centralized instant messaging and voice-over-IP service owned by United States tech conglomerate Meta Platforms. It allows users to send text, voice messages and video messages, make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other content."
1,The new update deleted all my chats and ALL MY IMAGES IN MY GALLERY! If I can give NO STARS I would!! I backup my messages EVERYDAY to make sure things like this doesn't happen and with the FORCED update and new download.. everything is gone. I feel robbed!
1,"Always low quality status gets uploaded, even though i have set upload quality to high in the settings. Status should be able to upload atleast 15 megabyte of videos but right now it cant even maintain video quality due to low upload capacity."
2,"Good app, but after I updated it, I can't make a video call and minimize the screen anymore, and can't use the recent vn audio feature."
2,"Whenever I go to share something on WhatsApp, the sending option takes me a long time , Any kind of photos videos or songs if i want to share on whatsapp it is not sharing as soon as . Please guide me about the WhatsApp problem."
2,The new sticker and emoji board update is absolutely rubbish. It is very inconvenient and unfriendly in terms of user friendliness.
1,"Useless app, no way to block people who are not in your contact list. Anyone can simply add your number and then message you and call you. Messages are not getting recived"
5,"sir i am giving you a suggestion . You have given this feature of who has seen the status. But who has seen how many times status, this should also be a feature . Please add this feature also. Thank you üôèüèªüòä"
3,video upload quality is too much bed. when I'm sending any video to other people the video quality is tooo poor. they can't see video in their fone even in WhatsApp I can't see video in proper quality. please fix it immediately and give choice to upload video in best quality.
4,It's good but you should remove the new emoji/stickers/gif keyboard update because I really cant use them anymore. Its too confusing. Then you should add the possibility of tagging more people like '@everyone'/'@everyoneonline'
1,When every we upload status it destroy the quality of photos and videos ...it's really bad experience with what's app kindly solve this issue...why it's reduced the image and video quality
4,"The latest update is not user friendly. Emojis should be easily accessible - as close as possible, the tab in between the text and emojis isn't helpful."
3,Everything's fine except for the whatsApp call glitch that sometimes when i call someone or receive a call suddenly the call sound set to the maximum and we can't even change that in order to change that we need to hang up the call and call again....
1,last update was the worst. you killed the option to send videos! and to send pictures on Android you have to go through nine circles of hell.
1,"The last update is bugged, the messages do not load when I send them and the margins are mismatched, it's necessary close and open the app to fix that temporarily"
1,it's very annoying when someone calls me via whatsApp I would give an example like if I had fight with my friend and I don't want to talk to him for some time I can make a setting that if he üìû me then my phone will forward his call until I make off the setting in this way I don't receive a call and he also don't know about it but what if I had blocked him then he wout come to know about it but whatsApp ruined this method and my friends can annoy me at that time so you need toüîß it out Now it la
3,PLEASE ANSWER MY REQUEST! 1) Could you add reaction on the status too? It would be helpful tq! 2) Can you please make a backup for the stickers too? ü•π I lost all my collections of stickers because my phone broke out. It would be helpful
4,"If i post something on status then it is very bad quality and i know it have a setting ok WhatsApp that best quality , and save data i di that satting but still so much bad quality i didn't understand what you all are doing ? If you didn't want to make this app properly work then leave your job no need if you can't make this ok"
4,"Awesome app üëåüëå, it is very useful for all the things , and a day is not done without watsup , expecting still more interesting updates and features from the team ."
1,What happened to the pop-up notifications? Now I can't tell when I have a message to reply to. It's exhausting having to go back and forth checking if my text have been replied to without notifications
1,"Hey developer I am encoutrng a problem. I am using whatsapp in i phone 12 pro max and yesterday while updating the app from app store following message appears ""Your account has been disabled in app store and i tunes"" Please tell me how to resolve this issue i am too much worried about my chats and media of that whatsapp. Because i am not having a backup even. Now i have login my same nmbr into another mobile but the same sms appears inthe i phone app store please help me darling."
2,"call quality is terrible. the volume is inconsistent, calls often go down even in stable network, nothing about the calls really works as it should"
5,"i have a suggestion. there should be an option for everyone in groups which may be called ""sleeping user"". The benefits for this user are:- 1. will remain in group permanently. 2. will not receive messages notification when opted for sleeping user. 3. he will not have to exit the group for unwanted messages. 4. when he feels need to be active in the group, he will opt for ""unsleeping user"" regards"
5,"Dear sir, Am not computer savvy, I have a little knowledge how to use mobile, suddenly stopped service, I tried s lot to restore but in vain. Whenever I tried to solve my problem always same question. But unable to handle pr. last 3days keep on trying to solve pls solve my problem. Now a days without WhatsApp like no hands please request to register my number. I have Only 1 number and 1 Mobile. Not more please help me and solve my problemd # the earliest. Thanks & Regards Amulya Barik"
3,"Just a suggestion,it will be good if you add and music option like facebook when uploading photo on status,hope the developer will bring this option for the next update."
3,1.Can't able to see status folder in WhatsApp file. 2.photos and videos are blurry. Can not send any multimedia content with original resolution.
1,All my photos/ videos when i upload in status....very bad poor quality...and videos was blur uploaded. I select in setting best quality....but nothing...fix the issue
2,I'm a long time user of WhatApp Messenger and it's really a good stuff. But it would be far better if WhatsApp can provide us with real-time backup facility. Waiting for your response.
1,App not working again. And the problem is that the creators are trying to supress the voice whenever it crashes.
2,"I only use to comunicate with relatives, friends and colleagues. I see no point in using the updates just so some companies can spam on our whatsapp. The least you can do is add a feature to get rid of them easily fir users who are not interested."
4,"Over all the experience is very good, I really like the new edit chat feature. But for reason the chat lock feature is not working for me ."
2,"I dont have any experience with this app. SORRY! I'm not a techy, it's your app, you should be able to rate yourself on the bases that you address other techy problems that knows what needs to be done. Thank you!"
5,"There is an error please fix it it's been couple of months, when we are uploading a picture status we can't apply filter on that picture after clicking on filter option another page opens and not working.Hope it will be fixed soon"
5,"Hi Whatsapp Would really appreciate if you make a provision of creating groups for status privacy, so that we can hide the status from specific people according to need. For example , we dont want some status to be visible to group A , and some to groupB , C etc. .as of now we need to change current status privacy every time."
1,This is the worst App I have seen in my life. It cannot be trusted for any serious use. Any cyber crime gang can lock you out of whatsapp very easily by reporting all your comments or requesting registration code for your number multiple times. You will loose all your customers friends without any notice. Cannot believe someone will design an app like this
2,Having a serious problem with app currently. I just got latest version and I'm unable to download media; pictures videos and the likes. Please do something about it real quick.
4,All are good but something missing Dear team please add the option story mention and story reactions and how many timees story seen and one more thing add music to story this what's app user's request thank youu!!!
2,"After the new update, the emoji/sticker/gif is too slow to open, making it difficult to reply a message quickly. Why changed it tho? It was alright beforehand ‚òπÔ∏è"
1,Worst and worst! Can't select all my post at once just like before! Can't select my own post that I want to view personally! Rubishh idea! Why add more random contents from unknown?! Rubbish idea! Not creative!
1,Watsapp is the great app. I want to tell the company to provide a version where you can put a photo or something written in the status like Instagram and put a song in it.. thank you.
1,"After update, whenever video call is coming, I'm unable to see. it is not showing in notification.. When I'm opening whatsApp then it will show who's calling."
2,"Pls bring back the old version, I don't like the new ""update"" version.. especially with the addition of channels, it's annoying and messy."
1,"Anytime I tried using Whatsapp a pop message shows up saying I need to use the the official Whatsapp before registering or login into my account, whereas that (official Whatsapp) is exactly what I'm using.. it's keep saying the same thing over and over again.....someone help."
4,This a nice and good app but you people can make it better so every person wants to use it.Give an option or function that the face lock is started so persons like us can open it without doing something.
2,Still I didn't get the upgrade version...and my screen sharing option is not included in my WhatsApp plzz regret itü•∫Add the filters..in the caption images......and..add the dlt feature like telegram dlt to tha opposite contact also....increase the size of the imojii üò∂‚ùï
4,It's a very good app and giving a better experience. But the only problem is it's status quality.. need to rectify that problem please set the status minimum size upto 16 mb.
5,Nice experience after using for many years.. One suggestion.. can't we increase pin chats from 3 to 6. This will help to get the expected messages from important communications. 3 is very limited would suggest to have atleast 6 chats able to pin..
2,I have been so much problem. Statuses keep loading even when the network is fast. Stickers are not working.i don't wht is wrong kindly please look into the issue.
3,"Hello Sir/Mam, While sending, receviing or downloading pics,videos on status,chats it saying sorry this media file doesn't open the download was unable to open the file plz try again later. pls let me know ! Warm Regards, Bikram Singh Bhui."
4,"Post recent update, lost downloaded images and showing now as blurred. And media storage location also changed automatically. Pls fix this"
4,"We all know Whatsapp, Great texting platform. It'd be great if they add the smooth effect when sending a message instead of it poping up all of a sudden"
2,On 24/7/23 i have updated my phone's software and also updated whatsapp since then i am facing problem in increasing and decreasing volume of whatsapp stories.whenever i try to inc. Or dec. Sound it gets stuck.
1,Now a days we are facing lots of problems in whatsapp it's a kind request to fix those problems that we are facing... I am facing the problems from many months but my problems are just fixed for temporary not permanent so kindly help me with those problems and fix it permanently...

1,"please, i have an issue here. I have realized that whatsapp is telling me, ""This account is not allowed to use whatsapp."" Could i get some help with this for me, please, and thank you. This happened this morning and I am at work and I have to use my phone i really need some assistance"
2,It is very nice app but there is a huge problem that when we upload status the quality of images and video become very low and it doesn't clearly appear so I request the team to pls do something about it
1,"I am very disappointed with my recent experience with whatsapp. The reasonbis that,i just woke up to see my account banned from using the app. I was requested to verify my info which i did but until this moment, i am having the same issue despite i was told that i would have my reply after 24 hours. This really affects my activity and is causing serious inconvinience."
4,The Latest recent Updation in WhatsApp is not so good for Hearing Voice Message and calls. The screen gets off by itself while hearing a voice message and on an ongoing call.. fix it properly
3,Blue tick (read by) function in what's app should have personalized modification option. It should be made available for selective people whom we wish to notify that his / her message is read...
1,This is the worst app.. Somebody can easily hack other accounts... my account is hacked and used by a foreign lady. I'm unable to use my account. I reported many times to what's app support.. but there is no use... Poor app
1,New update is so irritating. We cant see community messages directly.. when we click on community it shows all group and from there we have to search community and click on it again to see messages. Business will be affected hugely by this thing. Dear whatsapp please take back this changes in new update.
5,This is the best app ever. But please proceed eith your idea about screen sharing in the video call that you have publish it in the beta version because it is soooo usefull and pwork very good with no problems. Please publish this mechanism.
2,"Recent updates made everything busy. Crop tool needs more clicks, copy last sent message needs more clicks. Telegram is nicer to use now (shock, the Russian geek app feels better)."
4,"It's a good app to communicate with friends. But has a few limitations like unknown contacts appearing, etc."
1,"Error you are not using official version of what's app.. tried all the methods available on internet, send mail to developer, but of no use, getting an auto populated mail from their side."
1,I can see a bug. When I seea notification the whole notification tray is opening but then not closing. The phone is hanging. I need to lock screen and unlock
1,"Really third class app, I have been trying to get verification code of my number since 24 hours but haven't received it. Account gets blocked again and again I don't know why this happens to account of gentleman."
1,"After the recent update i can't play videos,gifs. Can't view stories as it says ""there was an error playing the video""."
3,"It's kind of mercurial. Sometimes strong & steady. Next day nothing. Still, thankful for it. Lots of people are able to talk to their friends and family with /because of this app."
1,"You guys cost me valuable chat time with the boys. There was over 1K missed messages because the app needed an update, and even with notifications marked on. I didn't see a single one. Appreciate it. üëé"

1,I've used this app for 7 years (half my life) and now all of a sudden for some reason my no. keeps getting marked as spam even though I didn't do anything. I even changed my number but the same day itself got blocked again.
1,Dear WhatsApp Team Some essue in WhatsApp some people sending messages in WhatsApp group ( Only Admin Can Send Messages ) using some Trick ... When admin can send messages only Then why some people send msg in group. please solve this problem as soon as possible.
2,"The reason behind that 2 start is only the bad quality of the video when I post it on my status, WhatsApp clearly change the quality so bad, from a good one to the most bad one , I hope it will change to at least a normal one in the future"
5,This is one of the best app have used. It's has helped me a lot the only adjustment I think should be there we android users should be able to message our viewers directly from the status when checking those who viewed our status
1,"When i updated my whatsapp,no stop loading and running for long times still under pending words come out and cannot be updated it. You said still one more to update but my handphone cannot update? What should i have to do it now?"
4,"This app has turned into nothing more than a place for hooker and escort come and randomly assigned numbers. App has become much better at giving the user control to eliminate "" bad callers or nuisance request"""

1,"New update i didn't receive all New features like edit font colour in status update.i see my friend can change the font colour, but mine did not have the features ask the ws cs is useless no way out."
4,Provide a feature to disable Group calls for specific groups. There are groups I have to be a part of but not need to attend daily calls. Provide a feature to make group calls auto reject/not ring.

3,"Whenever I click on a link for joining Whatsapp group through Google, it always starts a never ending ""Loading"", I think it's a bug that should be fixed ASAP for ease and trust of the users."

5,"Team, The option of editing messages is really good as you have created , but however I belive the time which has given to edit the messages of 15 mins es less , atleast we should have 30 mins to the same if needed."
3,"Please add *Account pause* option. Without deleting account we can pause WhatsApp so that we don't receive any new massege till the time we activate it. With this feature, we won't loose any data or chat history."
4,"This is good software, but I am facing a problem that when I install and registering it shows a message to use an official and block. If anyone has some suggestions, please reply."
4,App is undoubtedly user friendly. But why my WhatsApp is not getting updated now despite efforts and repeated updating process which lasts hours together. Thanks for Developer's quick guidence. After following all the steps suggested in their recent mail my What's App has now been updated. Thanks. üôè
2,"Urgent Complaint: Frequent Verification Codes for Unauthorized Device Logins. I am writing to express my deep concern and frustration regarding a recurring issue I am facing with my WhatsApp account. It seems that on a daily basis, I am receiving verification codes for another device login, even though I do not possess any other device associated with my account. Today, to my utmost dismay, someone logged out of my account from the device . What the hell is going on?"
2,"I would like to confirm that pictures sent are reduced to very bad quality Also whats realy annoying and very bad that im getting panned for no reason. Many times, i did complain, and there was no reply"
3,Could you kindly consider incorporating a feature within WhatsApp that enables the pinning of crucial messages within group conversations? Such an addition would undoubtedly prove immensely advantageous. Your attention to this matter would be highly appreciated.
4,"Communication is reliable, the call drop, might be due to signal strength. It can use dialer to make it really covinient."
4,"I like all of the updates in the app ‚úå they are real nice, I would suggest that you add tagging/mention feature in the status section and it should also have a privacy policy, that's just a suggestion from me."
3,"I can't get nowhere with this app. I wanted voice call few people in Europe for few minutes but I'm having constant problem to get there with call, doesn't go through. What's problem?"
2,"Why am i unable to log in into my account,i am getting messages like 'you need the official whatsapp to use this account', yet I'm using the official one.i started by getting messages like 'this account is not allowed to use whatsapp.chats are still on this device.request a review'.i got these messages and i verified my account more than ten times.please,help or you don't want me to use whatsapp."

5,This app is make everything very easy like my conversations with my contact people. Thank you WhatsApp for this easy method to talk people very easy and safe connecting people very easily and the end to end encryption is very safe for everyone But I suggest WhatsApp to do update chat lock bcoz there is privacy needed Thank you
5,"I like the app and rate it five stars but there is a future I would like the team to review. When I turn on disappearing massage for a specific number, that person should not see that I have turned it on"
1,I have been using whatsapp but after the update it says I need to use the Official App to log in. This has delayed my chats for 8 days since I updated. I have contacted you severally without any response. This is unfair considering the number of years I've been a loyal customer to the App. Is there a human other than the bots??
1,"Terrible, terrible experience. I haven't been able to access my account for 3 days now. Apparently I am not using the official WhatsApp now. So I searched for the official WhatsApp, which is exactly what I was using btw, and same problem. Guess now I'm back to regular messaging. Tha nks lotüôÑüôÑ"
1,"The latest update is very frustrating when trying to open emojis the keyboard does not open properly, also the animation in the switching keyboard from text to emojis make it very frustrating"
1,i hate the new update the 3 status button to select and delete multiple is gone. and to just see how many views without opening my own status. it sucks and the channel doesn't help too
1,"is it possible for us to post/upload pictures/screen recording at higher quality on whatsapp? im not sure if only happen to android devices, but the quality of my screen recording becomes so bad after i shared it on my status üò§"
3,Unnecessary sounds and musics are horrible and disturbing. It is saved automatically in audio player. Frustrated
1,Latest update (2.23.14) has a recurring bug with the emoji menu on Android. An update is being rolled out but the beta channel is full so we need to wait.
4,The application is amazing Infact the recent addition of the channel options updates etc But I miss the old display of status where you got to see the status divided into viewed and non viewed
3,"I used to love this app,the call is so clear,messaging is too fast.but since these past months adds is just much.its interfering the calls and when u are typing message."
5,‚ô¶Ô∏è Finally i switched From WhatsApp To Signal Private Messenger App. #New Year New Experience Try something new this year I have installed the Signal messaging app along with WhatsApp which is quite simple and easy to use and I am very impressed. You must try Signal once.
1,"Isn't allowing me to restore backup, second time I've had this problem,d o better! And if someone from tech reads this, send help cause my messages are important and I need them!"
3,"Group video call quality is not as before its definitely gone down. During one to one video call voice quality is good but with same members when in group video call, the voice quality is not good."
4,"WhatsApp has been incredibly great, bravo! In a case where groups are being dissolved, no one person can dissolve the group. Even if they are all removed they still have the group on their phones. Please we need a feature where the creator of the group can dismantle the group without leaving it on others' phones."
4,"I love using WhatsApp! But the recent update is killing me üò≠ please make the emoji/gif/sticker tab longer again! It's taking me forever to find what emoji or gif I want to send because the tab is so small now, even if I pull it up ü•≤"
2,Your current UI in which you have placed the menu bar in the bottom is weird for me. I am not comfortable with this ui. Either remove or give option to choose this feature by own to users.
4,Channels is rather intrusive. There should be a way to turn it off. Also it seems we can no longer search status.
5,"I recommend downloading this app it is really great to post whats going on with your life on your status and its great to video call and text, and have a voice note. What i love about whatsApp i can chat with my friends and family. Please download WhatsApp trust me you won't regret it. I hope this helped"
4,"I really enjoyed whatsapp chatting experience,I need one update , the user can use whatsapp in multiple mobiles that really help who are using multiple mobile devices, the whatsapp web features really good it work seamlessly, i am already write feedback on it but it is not yet updated please do it asap,thank you whatsapp team"
2,Not getting the verification code over SMS nor getting call back for getting verification code. Kindly fix the issue I'm also attaching the s/s which says Official What's App is not installed. Which is not correct. Need urgent help
1,"Why does WhatsApp have this much delay in bringing small updates, whereas other apps show up with different ideas even faster? Feels disappointed in using this app for every professional matter and that other apps don't get much attention in the spectrum. Stupid app."
5,"Assalamualaikum wa rehmat ul ALLAH i wabarakatu hu.It's a great application. I'm facing a problem from May. I can't see status, while I'm using Whatsapp it amiss all the status. I'm giving 5 stars because all over it's performance is so satisfying. Jazak'ALLAH u Khairan."

4,Good to see screen share Need to add markers. Will be easy to teach online classes just like zoom and other apps.
4,"Kindly,. 1. Introduce a ""Delete for All"" that Deletes messages completely, other Whatsapp apps still accessing deleted messages. 2. Make DELETED STATUS Disappear immediately and be unavailable to all viewers. Kindly work on that"
5,"Alls good..but I had something to say. Not much, I'll just say that It would be better if WhatsApp could be logged out like Facebook.Then people could not understand that they are available or not. It would be better to do just this one thing.Because in WhatsApp when people active in online then the messages go deliver and they can understand that he/ she is online.so I want to see that see people are messaging for or not. If this happen,this will be grateful for me."
1,I am using whatsapp since long and have nice experience but since last 3 days it stop and after my review it restore...something is wrong with my account and I cannot understand the reason for this. Please help me by stating reason and also requesting you to restore my account.
1,"I'm not giving any starts right now. Because the feature you added "" who can see when I'm online"". If no one can see other people online Is basically a bad feature. It is good for whom who stealthily want to run whatsapp. And make other people foolish. It's not good feature for parents who want to keep an eye on their children and for husband wife or gf bf. So please remove this feature if possible."
1,"The update is trash, I hate the channel collum, why can't I hide it, or put it at other section, don't ruin status, put it at different section, and why you change the muted status location??? It was perfect beforee broo"
1,When I opened my WhatsApp...Suddenly my every chats were deleted.. I don't know how my every chats became deleted.. How can I restore everything... I'm trying from 4 hours.... From Google drive I tried.. to backup..but after that also.. no backup chats... After doing backup..again it's showing that backup chats backup chats..why... Suddenly what happened to WhatsApp... From everywhere I did backup but.. after that.But failed..how ..could it's happens.. now I'm crying ü•∫ üò© I want every chats
1,WhatsApp has been working great up until now. But now I can't see statuses of anyone as the status won't download and it says try again later it never downloadsüòí. Also the status length needs to be increased
5,"Should allow all smart devices for example Sony experience devices UK made.. And other devices like ZTE, mobicel, Huawei.. What else am I forgetting to produce enough words to reach the minimum number of word that you require for some one to submit his or her quarry eesh I don't have anything to say"
1,I cannot unlock a chat after locking...its again again showing fingerprints unlock..after fingerprint is verified also its showing the same unlock with fingerprint...i am really tensed now..i updated the app...cleared cache..rebooted my phone.. Do something fast
5,It is a good app but many fake apps are made on the name of whatsapp and scammers are geting more chance to scam anyone plz this is a request to ban all the fake apps. There is one more good feature for payment directly. Nice!
1,"Can download docx, pdf and somefile to open later using appropriate application. For example docx, ms word error ""can not open file. Try saving the file on device and then open it"". Xiomi note 8 android 11"
1,I hate the idea if I wanted to keep using this app I can't use an older version. They are forcing me to update. I will probably uninstall this and get my contacts to use messenger. WhatsApp sucks.
1,"Error: ""You need the official whatsapp to use this account"" Using the original app. Reset-ed my phone and this error popped up. It's been more than 8 days, no response from whatsapp support."
1,Worst location app What the hell is wrong with you ? Why can't you update location? Whenever I msg the msg gets recieved to recipient but when I click refresh on location it doesn't gets updated.. WHY ? hire me if you need coding lessons
1,"Everything is fine, there are many new updates, they are very good, but if you delete the given pictures or videos from the phone, then the pictures are not visible. Is there any solution? It is a big problem."
2,Every time I call my wife over sea . The call only said connection and nothing happen. The calls doesn't go through at all. It was working at 1 point and now it doesn't. MY wife from oversea and myself are very disappointment that we cant communicate like before. What going on whatup.
2,After all it's so good where we can communicate around the world but video clips and photos I posted and received are no longer readable. Fix that and 5 Star üåü will be given.
1,"When i switch to stickers there is like 2 seconds when the slide leaves and the keyboard appears, before the update it was fine, dissapointed."
5,"Aight whatsapp i suddenly got an idea, how about u can send the picture but with song/sound, it can be any song/sound like the tiktok features and u can import it from ur music or something yeah that's my idea if u somehow use this idea make sure not to forget add a credit to me too"
5,This App is totally 'ui' User Friendly and fairly easy to use. Notification / Message 'Alerts' are straightforward to 'access'.
1,I had muted quite a number of contacts in the past ..Now with the new chanel feature am unable to search nor view muted status ü§® Wish there was a way to disable the channels display
1,The new update is the worst. There are many glitches like if you try to put a smiley in the middle of typing then the smiley sinks at the bottom making it hard to notice and continue typing. Horrible experience
3,Good App but nows days it shows the different times. Like new messages can come year 1945 and or 2060. I don't know why and also it keeps deleting the status I post and I doesn't gives the status posted by othe.. whyüò¢
4,I really love this app I always download it in my other mobiles cause it is the best app I could use but there is a big problem that I need the WhatsApp to solve when calling. When I call someone it doesn't let me call any body with network it have to be üì∂signal and I need one more update one WhatsApp that I can make any chat private like with password or smth so no one could read a private chat I hope this message is read to WhatsApp and the problems is solvedüí™üòÑüëå
3,Please remove the ring around ones chat for status viewing. It's even irritating now cause we can't view ones display picture without having to view the status on the chats.
1,"It's getting dark when use audio message, and when I play the message, I can't hear anything... Fix it please.."
3,"Please bring back the old system of emoji,sticker, and gif. Its makes me uncomfortable, It's a pain, when I want to use a sticker, I have to drag up to enlarge the selection üòíüòí"
2,"This is one of the best app for messages, voice call and video call. Since am using WhatsApp all my businesses and my messages have been secured, and it have made things very easy for me."
2,"I would have given it 5 STARS but can't now. What's the problem with this app, after uninstall and reinstall then it refuse to open why? It's so frustrating üò≠ please rectify this problem."
3,"Everything was going well until this feature came back where archived messages go back all the way down and any messages from archived chats comes back to regular chatsü§¶, very disappointed, please get that feature back where it stays in archived"
1,Your update is very stressful. I can't even scroll upwards to get a full interface for the emojis and stickers... It's really really uncomfortable
1,The only reason I gave this app 1 star is because I can't give it a 0....doesn't upload pictures to status in high quality and is for some reason occupying 5gig of my phone space but claims to be using 250mbs in storage and data settings(whatsapp)...
1,"Unable to share video on Status Or Share video to chats, post the new update it is showing this video can't be sent or Can't send this video choose a different video.. Earlier it used to accept all video types.."
1,"Bad !! From time to time, all of my whatsapp photos disappear from the gallery, and all new pictures sent on the app won't be downloaded to my phone gallery!"
1,Can you maintain the old stickers and emoji tray. It's difficult to navigate with the new design.
1,It has blocked my one number without valid reason. I have mailed the team like 20 times. They told me they have not found any malfunction but still my number is blocked. Very poor service
4,Wish I could get recent WhatsApp messages removed from top of most recent list and pushed to the bottom of the list of chats. Now must go through a time consuming process to put other chats ahead of recent messages
2,"After clearing data snd restoring the app,i lost important current chats. Why did my chat history just disappear and when i restore backup i only get one message for today???. My settings is resore daily. Twice this year now i encounter this problem"
4,"Please add screen sharing feature to all mobiles, it is very useful and make sure the sound should also share with the video, I think there is a glitch"
3,"My Whatsapp is great but somehow after have a call with someone up to 6-7 hours I can't call anymore without it saying ""Connecting"" and I find it irritating please fix that."
2,This whatsApp voice note is bad. It runs fast making unable to clearly hear what the voice is saying. This is too bad. It needs to be improved.
1,I get way more spam calls and messages than real ones! Don't install this is app unless you're ready to deal with fake spam calls and messages that try to steal your identity.
1,I do not see or get All the features on this phone Samsung galaxy note 20 android cannot see or have chat and the icons at the bottom ??? Why not ??? I need help the app does not show all the features ??
1,"Too much spam messages recently. Daily 20-30 spammers send messages at the same time for same thing.. like ""hye i m frm hr"". Do something that we can prevent receiving mesages from unknowns. Else whatsapp would be most hated app."
5,Some of the best app for video calling but some time the video graphics very low due to server and the images detail also in low quality i hope the moderater fix this issue soon thanks
5,"Whatsapp is really reliable and safe , I can actually ensure my chat's are safe but I'd prefer for it to have a handwriting setting to choose different fonts to give ppl a better experience pls I would love for there to be a font setting üôèüèª"
5,"Whatsapp is an amazing app for communication, it let's you call, send voice notes and send other files. If you want to do yourself a favor, download it"
5,All the features are very helpful.. But there should be a message scheduling option. Much needed
3,"This app is annoying lately. My account gets blocked too often. You should try to find a way to avoid the frequent blocking, it's too disturbing."
3,Samsung finally got it on my new phone but didn't hit restore. I was able to get back on old phone & did a backup of everything now I don't no how to restore it to the new phone. I tried to uninstall & reinstall but it didn't bring me to the restore page. I need help asap
1,"Broken pointless, loading forever & doesn't send, can't send full videos, crashes, uses 30gb of data in 4hours, 4hours sending a msg. Ect"
5,Keep up the good work and add more cool and interesting features and also we want to upload large files on status etc and also add a status saver feature to save status easily

4,"Of late I have been having problems with whatsApp which ended up closed that I cannot view anything. Answering your questions the App to manage my photos, YouTube,etc.is not somebody's business but you force people on it ."
1,Despite closely following the instructions the app refuses to link to my Samsung watch 5. After entering the 8 digit code on my phone I just get an error message on my watch 'something went wrong' with just the option to quit
2,Using WhatsApp is still difficult: editing is impossible; removing posts is limited to a few hours; removing a post is visible by others. So I prefer to use other apps like telegram.
3,Please remove the latest update which is to follow certain channels. I feel its really annoying since some other social medias already having same feature. Let WhatsApp be different from other social media.
1,I am trying to login my account with official whatsapp application from Google playstore but everytime it's shows that use official whatsapp for login for this account when I emailed to Concerned they said you are not using official whatsapp I had sent video proof screen shots but they are not admiting that they are wrong Very very poor customer service

3,"No option to remove WhatsApp status I don't want to see anyone's status not I want to post any status similarly I don't need community option too, WhatsApp should give user options to choose customise and change features they want to use, as it is a private app."

4,"The chat lock new feature that you have included in WhatsApp is very nice, but one of the things I thought was lacking is that when we come out while chatting in the chat lock and open WhatsApp again, the chat lock opens, which should not happen. If you have given chat lock feature then when you exit WhatsApp main page should open without lock chat. I hope you improve this this lock feature üôè"

1,The latest update for emojis and stickers bugs all the time and most of the times i can't extend the stickers and emojis list... it was better before.

5,"My star is for the support team, they are a good help to any problem you encounter in the application. Why not download it because you are assured of it's security"
1,This app has been detected as having high battery usage (even in background mode). Time for facebook devs to take a look and fix it.

4,"Nowdays many company used whatapps for communication and work. It will privileged if whatapps can add-in on camera mode ""document mode"" means u can snap any document and turn it into pdf or other file."

I'm not pleased with this. Let me verify my account in peace. I've already checked the features in this app n am not pleased with them. To me they are too low grade. So it's a bad experience for me.
1,From last 2 days it is continuously showing bug report I tried to fix it many times and the problem has been started after updating it I uninstalled and reinstalled but still not working
1,"I want to create a group or community I don't want people to let know or see others contacts ... WhatsApp is not giving this hide feature.. Need more privacy . I don't want to give you 1 üåü but this feature is really needed "" What's group members hide from other members "" hope I'll change my rating soon üòä‚ù§Ô∏è"
3,Updates are necessary. Not all updates are fit for the end user. Consider introducing one update at a time. Channels updates is not necessary.
1,Not able to turn off beautification mode when clicking photos through the front camera it automatically beautifies the face and there's no settings to turn that off
3,If I forward a received post and if I want to change some words of it especially the post with photos it can't be done. Kindly do the needful.
2,"WhatsApp photos not showing in my gallery even after media visibility is ON. This has been happen with me several times, give me some more information regarding this problem."
1,Whenever I try to upload pic on status it just reduce the actual quality of my pic even though pic was neither edited nor taken from other device but taken from my device only .I literally get disappointed from this.often it happens.

3,"the newly added keyboard opening/closing animation is really glitchy, the chat glitches in the keyboard closing animation and if i have my keyboard open and play a video then close it the entire ui glitches including the header and the chat and the keyboard, really bad please fix them asap"
1,New update makes emoji and keyboard switch too slow. I don't care for animations or switching between the two.
1,This app is just a trash a total waste of data U can't even save or download anything again on status rubbish upgrade very bad work indeed and it pained me when I found out that it mandatory to my phone if I still want to be doing WhatsApp this app don't even deserve ordinary thank u talkless of deserving star
5,"The next update should please be a view once status that is once a particular person views the status, it won't open for him again but the status will still be there for others to view and same follows when they're done and we should be able to foward audio or voice notes sent by a contact to our status"
3,Although it's very good application but because of my account is banned my work and everything is paused and having a lot of trouble because of it. Please WhatsApp look after it.
4,What to say about it no...need...its getting perfect by time....!...‚ò∫ has givel 4 stars cz it need an auto reply feature at a particular time in standard version too....ü•≤although greattt...üòç
2,Whatsapp we just want to have easy path of messaging. Not really need those channels. And its really troublesome to find status update. üëé
4,Great App keep up the good work.... Would be great if a seamless audio and video call can be achieved....
2,"The edit function is cool and all, but why can't I edit a message after it's been read üòî still have a weird glitch with the status being blank"
1,"I really don't like the new update, it keep the bar with stickers hidden at the botom it's hard to go back and forth."
3,The only reason I'm giving a 3 star is because of the quality of videos and images shared on whatsapp. The quality can be so poor sometimes.Facebook and Instagram aren't this poor at shared media quality.
1,WhatsApp got hacked easily anyone can use your personal data very easily and we can do nothing. Mainly privacy and security is not at all in this app and if we mail WhatsApp help center they can do nothing. WORST APP EVER.
5,This apps allowed you to communicate with friends and family all over the world and keep up with FaceTime video chat. Also some people can post interested video on it too
1,Not receiving verification code or call. I have changed my phone but now I'm not receiving verification code or call on new phone. I have tried dozens of time but unable to start WhatsApp.
1,"Kindly help as my WhatsApp account has been hacked with this number. Earlier it would throw me out of the account & send OTPs in middle of the night.

1,"Hi, after the latest update, the quality of the video we send/receive are not good. Anything new in setting that I need to change?"
3,Whatsapp is a very good and relianle app but there could be some improvements. Sometimes the app gets stuck or the service is bad. Otherwise whatsapp would be a really good app.
3,The new lock chat feature causes issue if one has to forward a message. It does not allow at all. Please look into this
1,The vote note is annoying as it stops playing when you hold your phone to your ear. And new update of emoji keyboard is annoying.
5,"This app is very important for usually life. Like that sms. Urgent requred massage, photo, documents, vedio calling, chating to closging familly and friends very few time. Its very usually app for all people."
3,"When i touch forward to, forward to... menu takes so long to show conacts, i can't forward any this new update,i never see forward to menu load proper in this new update"

Before , my whatsapp was working perfectly well and deserved 5 star before it started denying me access even when i reset my phone and lost all my data, It now tells me to use the OFFICIAL WHATSAPP Whats official then, If am using your very own link. This is all crazy. Coz i have used your very own link to download whatsapp multiple times but still cant register!!! So i cant socialise with humans"
1,Status upload Photo and video quality is very bad. If we send any good quality video or photo to anyone then same quality not received very bad quality received.

5,"It's very easy useful app. There is privacy features and fantasies app.Sir, whatsapp is not working in my device or phone. Why is the ban coming again and again. please rectify my problem on term condition Thank you"
1,The thing is that when you call someone on voice call it is always interupted and is never clear and video call is the worse you can't hear the person on the order line.
3,What up its been great for me as mode of communications but recently i been facing huge problem my apps keeps on disappearing on my desktop restore abd tells me my phone its full imust deleres apps that been there all times like all my banking apps to accesss it i dont know whats happenng cos i got lots of space on my memory card all i can say its doest funtion like its used too previously
5,I tried the chat lock option.. While locking it was good.. but unable to unlock as it is keep on showing the scan finger print pop-up again and again.. Neither finger print nor the PIN works.. why so? Chats once locked should not be unlocked ?

1,"My ""Edit"" button does not show.it disappeared after a day. Even after updating the app, it is still not showing. HELP, please üôè"
3,"Hi my WhatsApp is crashing and not opening up. It is showing that chat backup can't be restored.. kindly help.. it's been hours I am facin this issues, tried everything.."
1,"Why you are updating the unnecessary things, the first emjoi keypad was much better than the recent one, we are use too with that previous one. We want that emoji pallet back not this one."
5,The app is fantastic but since i updated the app it started decreasing the quality of the status videos thats the only problem i have....i surely do recommend it!
1,"After update Whatsapp, make more difficulties for me to pick and choose posting ! I have to go through one by one stories. I cannot share my Whatsapp status to Facebook and IG stories ! I want the stories to be share and easy for bussiness status üî•."
1,Telegram is much better and faster. Image no need to download and able to view after few years.

1,The UI is getting worse than ever I am facing ui glitches everywhere in the Stories in the chats. If it continues then I'll definitely move to another app.
3,"It's working nice but video & audio calls quality is not so good. In languages, Pashto is not included which is quite a discrimination."
1,"It is terrible. I started out paying 40 dollars, I'm on a low-income. And I cannot afford $50. I gotta remember Facebook it's really sick well, that's 40 bucks."
1,It's pretty useless as a messaging app when it suddenly decides not to let messages through in either direction.
4,It's truly a wonderful app with how it has simplified conversations. But it's only drawback is that it drops picture quality
1,If I had wanted the channel feature I could have gone with telegram Just keep it simple and distraction free Don't add useless features üò°üò°üò°ü´§
1,Very irritating with the multiple login. Cannot transfer chats or use the download from backup option. Asks me to wait for more than 3 hours just to use watsapp kn my new mobile.
1,Lots of data usage in voice call it's not good features I'm so irritate about this new update which was so redicilous .... please team remove this feature lots of data wasteing is there I really dislike this .
2,"Showing the wrong date in the chats. Also some chats are not visible, all happens after the last update."
5,Reliable source. Simple to use. But unable to open after update. Is it not danger to the documents or any other remedy?
1,"Whenever I am trying to set video status more than 30 seconds it is freezing after 30 seconds , please fix it as soon as possible"
2,"Was great before recent updates. My phone went blank when playing voice chat, lost control of my phone, gained back only when the voices end."
1,I'm disappointed in this brand. Went from good to bad. Recently updated the app and it's saying no connection even though my internet connection is very strong.
5,"Hi, Using this app is obviously GREAT but if possible please add an update that would let us categories our stickers that would be an absolute game changer & will save us quite some time. Thanks"
1,The last update is horrible. You can't see who saw your message in a group@ I have been using this app for almost 10 years. Never been unhappy like this time!
3,why is my phone number always blocked I've changed it twice but it's still blocked what's wrong with WhatsApp? please restore my number there are lots of important things like college work assignments and other files if I make a mistake I promise I won't do it again üôè
3,My Chat Sectition Is Not Showing Me I'm a Doctor and My Patience Are waiting from so long for my reply or appointment do resolve my problem asap try to understand my problem it's just showing me (You need the official WhatsApp to use this account) I already try to uninstall then reinstall from a play store but still not working.
5,I love Whatapp. However I wish video status update would be limited to 1-2 mins instead of 30seconds. I would also prefer for picture quality not to be reduced
3,Hello ü§ó Good morning WhatsApp team members. In WhatsApp I am cannot able to send a message or photo for 50 members instantly. I am needed to send it by 5 members. It is needed to be improved. In telegram they having unlimited count for it.

3,"Hello. My WhatsApp account has been banned. I don't know why, but the WhatsApp team told that I may do a violation of its conditions. I'm trying several times to recover it but it doesn't work.

1,I asked for help in customer support in regaining my number as I've been scammed into using my number in a WhatsApp Business account. I sent an email along with screenshots but it's been 9 days already and I still haven't received any response.
1,I'm facing issue on calls while using any wireless device. I tried multiple devices but the issue is same on all WhatsApp and wireless devices.
5,Exciting using the app but you guys should create the possibility of adding a number to group chats without saving them on your phone necessarily. Thanks!
4,"At first the app was good, but after some while, it will automatically block my account, like it's so annoying and so embarrassing, why is this happening,, and it's not even the first time"
1,There is an bug in updated WhatsApp. That new version of sticker tray is not working properly. It have a bug when it's popup
5,"I will suggest you to add a tagging feature for status, in which we could tag a person . Beside this everything else is good . Just think of it ."
3,I extremely love it! And also it's helpful for me...but also it's taking too much storage which is not good üö´hope this problem will be fix as soon as I hope
3,"Good Day, The WhatsApp √¨s the best way for communication. But it have sometime the connection 's problem. Please can you improve in that weakness!!! Thank you for your cooperation Jean Joseph Claude."
2,It's irritating when I saw my status seen the first person looks half in the bottom of the screen. Can you just take is simple as that.üôèüèª
1,status and vedios and gif files not sending properly . I try to send for 2 days but it's still sending the file even cannot update the status
5,"My experience has been an awesome one just that I'm having a serious problem, my account have been blocked for over 72 hours, what is the solution to it? please quickly review. Thanks"
1,"Can't send or receive media of any kind. Won't let me see anything but the blurred preview, won't let me send pictures or videos to anyone."
5,"The greatest App of the Internet Era. Fantastically formidable. Beyond compare, and reproach. Therefore, wholly commendable, and highly recommendable, henceforth, and futuristically thus then."
3,Been using successfully last few days and today it says I'm restricted for spam which is not the case. Annoyed and considering uninstalling if not fixed within 24 hours.
1,"Hi Dear What's app Developer Team, I am using this app from last 5 years and today suddenly I am not allowed to use the services from my registered mobile number, it is showing that what's app has taken a some review for my account and now I am not allowed to use my WhatsApp account with my registered number the app are forcing me to register a new number, I have tried every possible way to resolve this query like clearing the caches, uninstalled the app and lot more but nothing works."
1,whatsapp was a very useful app until it started blocking its users for no reasons ...i use whatsapp messenger from playstore and dont engage in any activities that violate terms and conditions but every time i log in they ban my number....it was the best app but its gonna be the worst app...kindly whatsapp look at this issue of banning users for no reason...if you dont want us to use remove it from playstore am completely frustrated ...üò§üò§üò§
1,I couldnt wait to complain about this. The emoji part is very problematic. You tap the emoji icon and all over sudden it pushes the input bar to the top. Can you please fix this please
3,Horrible new Emoji selector. It makes the whole app low. Please give an option to go back to the classic selector.
1,"The new emoji pick UI has bad experience. I'm used to the old UI. Please Dont change UI so much, it's too distracting."
1,To forward any images or videos make more loading and loading. In loading it takes lot of times. Plz make the solution of this. Because som time 2/35 minutes takes in loading in 5g.
5,App is overall good but the problem is with the delete for all option i think if we want to delete something there still that message tag remain that tells we send something earlier we want something like Instagram that there is no sign left that we send a message this should change
1,Why the f the sender need to resend the missing media from device Why can't just let me download the missing media This is clearly dumb and the other features are just bad as this one yet this shi still be the most used messaging app by people in my area Why just why there's clearly better alternative than this
1,"Hi whatsApp teams i want to tell you some feedback about the recent update. Nowadays whatsapp is going down and down because of new features in it, we use to get confuse in doing text sending status and all so plz fix that problems hope you all get this feedback."

4,"Everything going good,enjoying latest functions, But the only problem is the quality of status and during sending the video,the quality ruins,do something üôè"
4,"The new update on emoji when you typing to someone it's getting harder I'm not used to the new emoji update, there has been change on the emoji layout. It was easier on previous update"
4,Don't put archived chat all the way below chats like the other reviews says. Assign such that people can adjust archive chats position or even hide it entirely. Same with statuses.
5,As Africans this App fit our needs according to recharging.You get your friends fast anytime you need him or her.It is a cheapest ever communication app on earth.It is like a radio station to look at it all the time and listen to it.
4,"Awesome app..‚ù§ But if there a separate group for every moods like (Office, family, friends, fun) then we had much happy.. Because some time wrongly we send funny gif into ours office group then face embarrassing situations.."
3,"While agreeing the terms and conditions for using whattsapp messenger and inputting my account number no verification codes received and a notification pops up indicaing ""number not verified tap to verify your phone number"". Then the Whatsapp messager app itself direct from Google pray store claims ""you need an official Whatsapp to use this account"" What's happineng?"
5,Awesome app. But it would be better if normal messages and group messages were on separate interface.
1,The latest update is the worst update I've ever seen. The structure of emojis arrangement has changed. Why? We don't like this at all.
5,My app is currently not opening it's closed due to some spam issues but I'm not related with all those i think so please refreshly let me open my WhatsApp app . I have also uninstalled and installed it once but it's not working. Please fix this issue as soon as possible
1,"Not good when it comes to privacy, weird things happened after had conversation with friends on a topic, same kind of Ads were shown. Not happy with thing kind of Trade practices by Meta Inc."
1,I've been blocked severally from this app with no reason and now they would not allow me to log back into my account. For such a big company it needs better maintenance .
5,Wonderful app. To communicate with my children as well as grandkids. I wish I could afford to pay for more options on a very limited income. But it works just fine. Love it.
4,Really great improvement but you guys should work on the disappearing messages so that it will only affect the one who set the timer and not both parties
3,"Actually the app is fine and all I enjoy using it but I'm not sure what has been updated about the app yetü§î and also I don't like updating all the time it's stressful like this year alone it's been updated 4, 5 times"
3,"When you upload status, then the status quality decreases, the video becomes blurred, please work this feature .... the video quality decreases when the status is applied.picture pixels are reduced.."
2,"The new sticker ui menu sucks, I can't find my stickers as easily as before, and why does the section take up half of my screen?? Please change it back."
4,"Hello you have given very good pictures but add two more features to it, one delete message will remain and second status saver. Thankyou you so much whatsapp"
2,"Sir, if you guys are working for so much privacy. In WhatsApp, please do one more privacy setting so that strangers who receive direct calls or messages on WhatsApp. Please do not make any direct message or call to convert it into a request. Sir its a very big problem please solved as soon as possible"
5,I have been using WhatsApp since a year But now accidently my WhatsApp is logged out and now the notification of downloading official WhatsApp is showing on screen and tried my best to contact the WhatsApp team but no one is replying nor solving this So I think I should move on to another app like telegram. Because it has a lot of bots and so many features and so on. Yet none replied. And yet I haven't gotten the solution. Whatsapp team can't do anything. Because lot of Indians are using this.
3,"I hope to add a list to separate groups and individual chats to make it easier to use, with the addition of more features and the removal of the channel list."
1,"This app is useless,it just bans account unnecessarily and when i was just chatting it banned my account. And for the past 2 days i have been trying to unban it,please do not download it,it is a scam and a waste of data,battery and storage space. I'm giving it 1 star because there is no zero stars"
3,"Date is not showing 1 week Older messages, only day it shows. For example, When ever i want date of 5 days before message it show Wednesday after i will go to calender and search the date. Sooo much irritating. Please try to understand and develop it"
4,"Good app for communication, video calling and for text.... But I think they need to be some medication in some fields like privacy, dilating massages by some one and etc"
2,"dear whatsapp, im very disapointed with the app...you can put channel in new update but still didn't put high resolution in status for video...its been a while im waiting for the resolution to update into original quality...two star for you"
3,"It was better before . Now. I noticed that when I upload any Videos in Status , the quality becomes worst . Blurry & drizzy type . üò° Not expected this from WhatsApp ."
1,Remove the payment feature which is no good for anyone. If you can't pay drvs for a stable payment platform dont launch it. I lost my money now and will definitely take it with consumer forum if dispute failes.
1,It was horrible experience with whats app it blocks my 2 no.s with in the 24 hrs. I can't use my account now and how many no. We purchase to use what's app don't understand!

5,"The app is becoming frustrating after downloading the lastest version , I can't even download voice note nor videos or view posts . Please work on it and tread as urgent."
1,It has been difficult logging in to the app since the update. I have un installed it several times and installed again yet no difference.
1,"New update is absolute trash...! After clicking to watsapp imoji in keyboard, the typing bar will pop up to top and I can't even see what I have written previous"
1,"This app is a waste of time, when I try to log into my account it keep showing that this is not WhatsApp official app and won't even verify my phone number, pls the developers should see to it that this is corrected."
2,Improve Or Add These Features - 1. Disappear messages in 12 hrs or whatever timer user Set 2. Status video limit increase to 45 sec or 1 min 3. Add Button to convert Video call to audio call directly 4. Increased Audio and Video Sending Limit to 500 MB or 2-3 hrs . 5. Add Some Filters to improve sending pics
3,It is very impossible for me to change from old contact to new contact. Have tried several times but failed. Really need your help.
1,The latest update of WhatsApp currently shows some of the contacts we have saved on our phone is unsaved numbers and cannot be saved again. So rectify this issue.
2,"Ever since the video quality update, the status videos have become terrible, with pixelated and distorted images. It's the worst compression ever"
1,"Disgusting app, Worst service Not sending me login code, I'm trying about 4 to 5 days always show we couldn't call try after 1 hour , text after 24 hours... This message showing me from 4 to 5 days... How i can fix it.."

4,My experience is very good but now I don't know why it's blocked automatically and it's not open on my same number which is use to be last 7 year's
5,Very good app for social contact. I want to say one thing to you please ad a separate column for the groups in your next updates. It will be your huge favour.
2,What have they done since the last update? The emoji display that almost hidden at the bottom of the screen is am abomination. Renders it unusable...
3,It's a good multimedia messaging app... one thing need to develop that there should be different front styles and different front colours should be available...
1,I'm trying to open the app since yesterday but every single time the same issue appears 'this number is not verified you r not using official WhatsApp' what is this behaviour yrr I'm trying from the official website only. If you can slove this please do it.

1,This app is good but before 3 months working too badly due to 3 reasons 1=it don't make yes when other see your message 2=it don't pop up when other call to us 3=when screen/monitor is off it don't pop-up for any call and message please solve it üôè
1,I log out once when I login again now i have glitch. When I send msg someone It didn't show me that they see it. And I didn't off the read notification it's on. Still have that problem
2,"This new update doesn't settle well with me. Why on earth am I seeing the gestures (chats, status, calls an community) below my phone? Why was it removed from the top where it normally stays? Please change this already."
4,I hope that you'll provide an option for a total no-notification icon for group chat. Sometimes I find it disturbing.
5,"Why don't you add Dp to Dv, like a video to Dp. Converting a video into 3 seconds gif file and changing it to live profile pictures. Hope it will come soon too..."
1,"Return the emoji tap as it was before , the new one is so bad And the status section is also being bad since it become like instgram the full name doesn't show up and its confusing"

3,Please give a feature update to 1. Select and Copy specific or particular portions of a long written text message. 2. Share audio files directly from gallery or file manager.
4,"Fix YouTube links glitching out constantly on WhatsApp, and the error of constant chat scrolling when listening to voice notes... PLEASE!!!!!!!!"
1,I often forget the name of the group I belong to. WhatsApp should have a special tab for groups so that we don't find it difficult to find and to be more organized.
1,I tried to upload the video on whatsapp status but it couldn't send to status whtsapp. Then i want to delete the unsent vdeo on status but no delete button appears. So annoying

1,"I was logged out of my account for 4 months. When I was finally able to log back in, I lost all of the messages that I would have gotten during that time. The customer support was the absolute worst. They did not even try to help me."
4,Latest update (as of Aug 12/2023) has a weird bug with the keyboard and it's slower to change between letters and emojis. Hopefully it'll be fixed soon
1,The latest emoji keyboard update is a step backwards. At least for SwiftKey users. It required an additional tap to re-open the keyboard after using an emoji... Not cool
1,"I am getting can't send this video choose a different video when I am trying to send videos, check this error and fix this if anyone from developer team is watching this"
2,"Why have you removed the ""Add to existing contact feature""... Now instead of merging contacts with different phone numbers, I now have them appearing separately. Please fix!"
3,Hey developer i just want to ask you why WhatsApp status filters are not working? Whenever i used to add a picture and change filter only last filter is working why it is so?
1,This app is now giving me a lots of problems and nobody is there to talk about. You can only contact through mail and if you are not getting solution of your problem nobody will talk to you about your problem. So i suggest better use insta or snapchat or now threads rather using this app.
1,Media quality option in settings tab is not showing. Whenever i upload the status video . It is blur. Why you removed that functionality
3,New Update is Awesome but a problem that in facing right now that's my video can't send it shows me sending error most of times and 2ndly videos also can't be post on Status... What's that Problem kindly suggest me
1,"I just came here to give 1 star ‚≠ê.. because Whatsapp needs a lot of improvement. Sometimes the status I post is not what I see.. Whatsapp cut some parts of the video itself.. again, separate group chat from normal chat's.. this is really annoying"
3,Good day Guys. I really love this app because it has been helping me a lot in school and social life. But now I have a very big issue that has affected my life. My whatsap is not working again and this has really affected my school and social life. I even have a project to submit with my whatsap and all the details to use. I have dropped a complaint on your email via customer service. Please this is very important to me kindly sort out the issue. Thanks for your understanding and consideration
2,Worst thing ever....why the recordings are cannot be listened to whom its send....why this is...plz see in this matter....example- I am sending a voice recording to someone they can't listen that....saying that they can't listen anything....pls see why this is happening
1,I don't like the current update where I'm forced to view updates which obscures my muted status. Separate them or put them as part of the menu on the 3 dots far right. Made my entertainment boring
1,"Why original media doesn't upload on my status why why please solve this problem üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢ it's good app but still one reason I'll gave one star because long time we faced one issue why we don't upload original media in my status sir we charged data charges then this is our problem that we upload low or high content please stop this nonsense and solve this issue Please resolve this issue as soon as possible, I hope you will take it seriously"
1,"It's been very bad. WhatsApp keeps infringing on my right. It doesn't allow me do my business, they keep blocking my number, it's very frustrating."
1,I can't send a single image or a pdf or a document. Plz resolve my problem. It takes too much time to send a single image which is in kilo bite.
3,In recent times I saw that it's end to end encryption is not working Which status I saw that suddenly showing in my YouTube but I didn't search that So it's a very big problem and it is not expected
5,"Over time, have to commend WhatsApp as one of the best social apps. However, i wish to recommend that the development team should include and makenit possible for chats to be group and search by dates."
4,It's been good but android users are unable to forward messages on WhatsApp. It's always taking ages to load the contact to forward message too.
3,"The update aren't that much, just waste of data One of the update is just addition of emoji nonsense It's kinda annoying not being able to access a message cause of update and when updated you just see trash"
2,"Hello..... my account has been banned from using this app all of a sudden,, it kept telling me that i'm using unofficial whatsApp, and when i follow the link you kept for the official whatsApp i still arive at the same app on my phone showing me uninstall or open which means i'm using the official one.... you guys have to do something pls"
1,"New feature to transfer chat? Useless. It always logged out instantly, so i couldn't scan the qr."
2,"I hace the updated version of what's app but it says that ,""you need the official account to use this whatsapp account. Please solve this problem as soon as possible . Thanks you"
5,"Better ways of communications, information, and media sharing got far reaching into people's much easier than ever before."
4,"Great messaging app of this era, it provides security, but also needs some improvement like when a person deletes a message it notifies the other person, that should not be happen"
1,A great app BUT photo and video quality deteriorates a lot when sent. I'd love if that gets fixed.
2,The imoji keyboard is not popping up properly.. which means it's popping like a small box not in the full size of the Key bord. That's very irritating. Please fix this.
3,The app is okay but you have been blocking my number for a number of times now and it is not good at all. After I verify its saying I need to wait for hours to get the code. Please work on that.
2,WhatsApp should please increase the size of file that can be sent through this medium. You can't expect me to share files less than 16mb and still stick with you guys.
1,The disappearing messages feature is the worst feature in whole of WhatsApp. It's a feature that is useful mainly for cheaters in a relationship. So that they don't get caught. It's a feature for provoking people to cheat in a marriage or love relationship and have multiple affairs.
2,"This app features update are getting worse. Literally giving a bug problem for me. This app are really great before a not necessary update but after that, everything just become worst."
3,"Why so hard delete status on whatsapp like before can delete all in one, now have to delete one by one. And also what function Channel under status? Its useless and dont know what motive is it. Overall whatsapp slowly meh. Better add on setting hide this CHANNEL"
4,The new voice note for groups is not too nice as all group members can just click on it and it goes to everyone at once. Only admin should see the voice note button
3,Today's update about screen sharing is good thing but there is problem in that is while sharing the screen the system media volume is not visible to another person who is the call so please check it and take to on
3,Whatsapp web beta isn't working and it's not possible to ignore the message after 7 days anymore. Leaving the program isn't possible either without uninstalling.
1,Make a pitch black theme available. And also why the option to show messages in notification while being mute is removed..it was a good option Also include an option for @everyone to mention everyone in the group
5,Please extend the duration of status upload duration and the status upload quality is not good please fix this issue. Otherwise this app is great and working properly.
3,"I need some help, my whatsapp always crash when trying to backup the data, i try to clear the cache, i try to restart my phone, but still doesn't work..."
5,"My experience with this app is always the best but sometimes messages doesn't go faster so please the management should work on that for us , but the app is always best thanks üëç."
1,It ruins the quality of photos and videos when shared on status. If u don't want us to share it don't give that as an option
2,"Notifications don't stay on lockscreen even after disabling battery optimisation, putting on high priority. Android 13, realme 11 pro plus"
2,"WhatsApp changes your pictures to low quality, this is unacceptable!üò°üò°üò° I am not happy & I am not the only one who is experiencing this! It needs to be fixed.üò°üò°üò°"
3,"The updates! They're too much üò≠ some people prefer the classic form, now I find it a bit hard to navigate through the app!"
5,"Amazing app for chatting, sending photos, videos, and even can transfer money too. Really Amazing."
1,From last 6 months it is crashing for every 15-20 days and once itstarts crashing I couldn't access it without reinstalling it again.
1,"The latest update wants to force channels down my throat, it's completely unnecessary and there should be an option for switching it off"
1,Enough!!! I am getting a lot spam messages. Reporting doesn't help. Everytime a get messages from different numbers. I am going to uninstall.
5,Personally I think it's a good app. But the recent update have been giving me issues. I can't find all the contacts I've locked
4,Whatsapp has fulfilled many of my daily needs let it be sharing files staying in contact with friends and family far away or businesses or help us in organizing small groups. One of the features i would like to see is schedule the msgs. If any developer is reading this please try to integrate this small feature. It takes time but this ability to send scheduled messages will change most thigs. Imagine going on a hike and not being able to wish a happy birthday to family somewhile you are offline.
1,Worst experience ever if you do not restore backed up chat while opening the app first time then there is no option to restore.and if it was end to end encrypted and you forgotten the password then you cannot recover by clicking forgot password.
4,Awesome app and this is batter than all other apps. I like it very much. But sometimes it's not working in my region. I don't know why this is happening regularly üòëüòë

1,WhatsApp messenger is really an annoying application I've tried registering my account for over three weeks but it refused to send me a verification code. I think this new version is bad at all
1,"I wanted to set my status image from gallery, why whatsapp i asking camera access? This is really a very worst and ridiculous thing. Very dangerous in terms of privacy."

2,Am finding it difficult to install the app in my device. It's saying the app will be installed soon in my device but it's not showing I tried this many times Please help
3,"New update with animation to load emojo bar? Very inconvenient, please change back to when emojis just loaded instantly. Thos makes messaging a mucb more frustrating experience"
1,The emoji and sticker keyboard cover the whole screen when i try to use it and it's so inconvenient. I'm so disappointed.
1,"Hi team, whatsup Have a big issue if i see statuses of people at one time then again i can't able to see my statuses are dissapering even though the people didn't hiding status.please fix my issue as soon as possible"
4,Really good app but till there have some point to develop . someone block some friends for stop disturbing from them . That is no facct . but And some unknown numbers who use somuch slang or like frod massage so then their must have another additional step that his account may be useless for sevarel months...also before this community will alart him with proper investigation üôÇ
1,"Hi, My WhatsApp account is using other person. I'm trying to login but it's not working.. why? It's not safe for me. My personal account and phone number please fix it's. And two step verification is problem.please fix my account"
1,"What's is wrong with the notification sound, it has disappeared. I've checked all the settings."
3,"Have used WhatsApp for as long as I can remember. Could really make use of the new 'search by date' feature in messages, but this only appears to be available on IOS and not android?"
5,"If you want to put archives at the least then, Go to whatsApp settings. Then chats. Toggle of the ""keep chats archived"" (You'll find it after a bit of scrolling.)"
2,"Lost all the chats, groups and media after reinstallation of the app even after backing up every single thing!! Please look into this matter asap"
5,Make a reaction button on status so we can react. But in present case if we react on status then a message is sent to the user. Change it to only reaction on status not directly messaging.
1,"It is a bug or missing use case of WhatsApp, how one will enter code in case of a broken phone or stolen phone. The WhatsApp team should think about it. WhatsApp is asking to use your other phone to enter the 6 digit code to confirm moving the WhatsApp to another phone."
5,I think you need to make it possible for users to message directly from the status It makes it more convenient for people with numerous contacts and clients
5,"There should b an installation option of log out or deactivation here also in WhatsApp like other apps. So if one needs a break ...it would be easier. Pls if possible , then work n allow this update in WhatsApp. Thanks"
1,Improve your status quality.whenever I put something on status it's quality get's very low 1080p to directly 360p this is very bad error or glitch because it doesn't happens before
5,"My feel back is why not whatapp chart editing be as anytime you want to edit it, secondly cant whatapp operate in different sim in one phone just like sms on sim one and sim two so that if you want to use sim one you can use and if you want to use sim two you use. Thanks"
3,The watsapp is a great üòÉ way of communicating with others but there are a few glitches üòû such as the voice calls don't have that good quality but you can still enjoy Join watsup nowü•∫ü•∞
4,"WhatsApp cannot put to deep sleep, else cannot restoring backup. Even restored there will pictures and videos missing.üòü"
2,please consider this as important!üéà There should be an option to open wattsapp either fingerprint or PIN. As sometime if the fingerprint didn't work we atleast are on safer side to open wattsapp agian.
5,I think it would be beneficial if you added the option to lock the chat eith face ID aswell as I can't scan my fingerprint without taking my phonecase off. Have a nice day xxx
3,"Unable to Restore chats. I cannot believe in this day and age, there is no simple way to Restore deleted chats whith out uninstalling and re installing, come in WhatsApp, get it sorted.! üò°"

1,Just reading through the reviews and spotted messages being duplicated by bots. Everything copied word for word. The app store is fake.
2,Good messaging app but it's unable to change the accent color. If you don't like the green one.
2,Whatsapp forcefully compresses even small sized videos like 1-2 MB as well and make them blurry. I have already selected 'best' quality media upload settings.

1,After the latest update when I make video call I can see myself as a huge elephant and tall like giraffe I thought it is my mobile problem but when I do video call in other apps it's normal but in this app it is weird..
5,"Need Delete Message History. Sothat We can check or copy a message which is accidently deleted. or, a 'Undo delete' option visible for 20 seconds could be helpful. After 20 seconds undo option will disappear."
2,"Before this recent update it used to show lock chats in the chats option but after update we are unable to see . It used to pop up chats 1 left like that , pls do it like before."
3,"It's the best app for chating with friends , parents & others people . In fact in this app we are send message & others document. It's best app for me that i am realised."
4,"Better if watsapp have the update of selecting people for hide and show the status like office colleagues, family,just friends and bestfriends categorised options so that we can upload status by selecting people accordingly who can see the status...."
1,I hate it's new format. Have to scroll down for long to find emoji. It's so disturbing. You shouldn't play with basic settings üò≠

5,This app does not give proper black colour . It's too greyish . Please whatsapp fully dark the whatsapp in dark mode please ü•∫. Thankyou . I wish you will make this change soon.
2,"Anytime I open the app, it keeps asking to back up and each time I pick never, it asks the same question everytime I open the app. Please fix it!"
5,"Awsome..but I think that this app needs a feature like group, chat , status separate. In this feature we get easily message group chat because there are many messages....but Its amazing ü§©"
3,Guys please help this latest version longer have an option of No auto save to mobile now every picture i view every video every voice note are stored automatically on my device of which i don't like
1,"new update is just annoying, the old interface was perfect, i really dont know why you keep changing interfaces for no reason"
1,"Calls are horrible you can't even silent incoming calls, logs are horrible shows the wrong time and doesn't even show the duration of the call"
1,"This application is just useless that you will keep updating and after that initializing that after the end of the day you won't still be able to use it. I will send messages, it won't deliver till the second day, someone too will send me messages, it won't deliver on time. Very useless application, arrant nonsense and total rubbish from Meta."
5,You should enable spamming option into your app. It's quite annoying to be saving contact before messaging them. Please look into this and integrate it there
2,Red color msg notification does not appear on my WhatsApp Green Logo whenever i get new messages. Kindly fix up my issue ASAP else i will be pushed to remove Whatsapp & go for imo. Thank you

4,Nice app but it always keeps putting videos on landscape and it expands on entire screen.
2,What is the use if we can clearly see the locked chats it's same as archived no use so better change itt Nd add face lock to unlock locked chats and calling time is not updating..
1,"Why I am unable to create my whtsapp account.. It's shows ,my number is ban ...but I didn't do anything wrong.i always follow whatsapp guidelines, and policies. Plz unban my account.. and reso lve my problem as soon as possible.."
1,My WhatsApp can't give me verification code I don't know why and now it is two months since I started signing in. How can I receive Whatsapp verification code through email please help me
1,Can you add option to download status instead having to ask people to send us. And whatsapp gb is way better they have more themes you post longer status and more that 30 liia
1,"A number which is not saved in my contacts has viewed my status even though my status privacy is set to contacts only. Even stranger, I have NEVER interacted with this number before and have zero record of it in my phones, contacts, calls or sms. I contacted WhatsApp hlep TWICE and received automated response that had nothing to do with my issue. There has been a breach in my privacy settings and I'd like it to be resolved."
1,I got unwanted calls and messages. Please add this option: I dont want call or message from unsaved mobile numbers. Simply i want message and calls from my saved contacts only.
4,"Can you please show, individual and group messages in different tab, which is better to identify messages... Thanks in advance"
1,Very angry because I kept downloading the same app after trying to use it and failed. The app on my phone just can't work and yet its newly downloaded!
4,"Everything is perfect, but we need to be able to upload HD videos and imageson statuses."
3,"The functionalities of this app is good. But the one and only drawback is that when we touch the dp it will redirect us to view the status of that particular person. If that person's status is already muted by me because of the irritation or etc, that feature is redirect me to that status. Omitting this feature in your future update would be better."
3,I hate seeing zuckerberg's face everytime i check my friends' updates.... please stop suggesting to follow him or add the option to disable channels
1,Worst app adding useless features like adding channel and not giving any option to turn off or disable it.
3,I was impressed with new features but one problem in chat lock I am normal phone user My phone doesn't have fingerprint sensor in it my phone is redmi 9a it has password but whatsapp chatlock asks me to type passcode but it doesn't work this is the problem solve it
5,The PlayStore has has all the app you need and it is very efficient. I highly recommend it.
4,"Most definitely the best app ever, but all i need from the developer is ""(search by date: time) I mean if i want to search my January or April 4th chats. I hope you review my comment well"
2,The emoji now sucks. Why the need to add animation when showing emoji window? Often times the window does not even slide up all the way and no emoji is shown. Truly a downgrade
3,Team WhatsApp........the clarity of photo or video to be added in the status is damn low....1080p video when posted in status becomes 240 p....what are doing with the clarity .
1,Trash application after the channel update. They just keep on forcing me to subscribe to channels despite having zero interest in it.
2,"I can't send or receive any pictures or videos, I've tried all the help link or feedback thing explaning my problem several times but it isn't doing any good, Please fix"
5,"Best social media app ever. With time I think there should be an option for me to set when my status update expires, I may want it there for 30hrs, can we have an option where I can set the hours but should be limited to some hours ofcourse. Then about updating songs or videos, can it be automatic to upload videos/songs then the system splits them automatically to 30seconds, having to keep selecting 30secs each time can be tedious if I'm posting a long video. Otherwise great app WhatsApp is."
2,i have a problem with data back up. whenever i uninstall whatsapp and reinstall it ..............i can't get previous data of locked chats
5,This is a great app for people that message often. It has privacy and all kinds of stuff great app. I would recommend it
1,Why WhatsApp why ??? in feature of you wont to update the App just Ask the users. because in last update when add this channels to state's it ruined the whole thing ...return to the old please üëéüëéüëé
4,"I don't know why they added the channel concept in the status area, remove itü§Æ Take the previous settings back ."
3,We want Old WhatsApp because Thier Emojis is easily found....and this update version is too confusing......üòï...Please Think about the old version.....they are good for us....and thier simplicity are more attractive......ü§ûüò∂üò∂
5,Overall the features are good b√∫t the new features of video message should have filter too ü§£i and i want whstapp team to add call recording feature tooo..

4,"can you do something for status caption, when people press it if long sentence to read,the video stop, some caption mean to connect to the video and the song, can you do some rework please."
4,Am enjoying more than 100% of functionality. Please we need to be able to pin message on the group. Add the message pinning feature just like telegram own for group.
1,I put the video status has been today the video is full hd but the status I see to 1 minutes after video not cleared fully cracked please solve this problem quickly
2,It has always been fine but recently when i open payments it just crashes back to chat menu. Been very troubled lately. Dunno how to fix this. Might be due to overload of payment history but cant clear it seperately from other data like clearing cache.
5,"Suggestion: On Instagram, we are able to add music to our stories... can this feature of adding music be updated on whatsapp story."
1,In status tab. Search option removed. If i have to see a person status i just search name and find out status but this option removed its very hard to use WhatsApp
4,I rate it 4r stars because since last update it have some technical issue ....status of my contacts members disappears after some time which is a big deal
4,You need to add categories for stickers. Because I have tons of stickers in the favourite and I can hardly find the sticker I want. So I would like to be able to add categories for myself to be able to easily find the sticker I want.
5,I am unable to open my WhatsApp. It is asking to install official WhatsApp. I am getting this app only online. As your customer advice it is not possible to buy or change another phone. Moreover without getting opened the WhatsApp it is not possible to take backup. I am un distress position. No one is able to help. Is there any solution.
5,"Awesome app, but for some reason, I cannot check my status update. It does not give me that option to go into that status I just added, what is happening? Anyone know. Please? üôèüôè"
4,"In whatsapp for smartwatch, I'm getting frequent notifications for old messages which are already viewed... It is giving notifications randomly for old messages which are even 2 week old"
1,I can't log in my account. The verification code is not coming. My mobile sim card everything is fine but the verification code is not coming. I have mailed many times but no solution. ‚Äã
3,"When I am trying to recover the chats from Google Drive backup , app says unable to recover chats from this backup, ..... Whatsapp whats this .......if you app can't recover the chats back then why to backup.....??????"
3,"Bugs or errors in encryption process or backups of encrypted content. Multiple messages to support and no one even understands the problem, no way to report as an error if the support process can't understand basic questions. I've attempted to explain in several different ways with illustrated examples and screenshots, support still doesn't understand the subject of my issue. Impressively bad and useless support process."
4,Whatsapp is good but only one problem I have status is only for 30sec which is not satisfied to any one 01 min is very good. 30sec not intresting to watch status plz increase the seconds.
4,There's a bug. Even if i delete a contact from my phone why does it still appearing in whatsApp contact list.???
1,"Very disgusting I downloaded and installed but where it rejects my number and says that my number can only be used with the original WhatsApp and it cannot be used with any other, so time wasting just hate it."
1,"whatsapp, yo whatsapp and updating it and after updating your whatsapp is not opening and there you are facing the problem of You Need The Official Whatsapp to Use This Account So how do you fix it?"
2,"Unable to use WhatsApp via voice control/hey Google which was great for when i was driving and wanted to send a message or reply to one. The app worked perfectly until about 8 weeks ago, and despite all permissions being set up and ""allowed"" it still won't work! The app still works if I manually open it and type a message!"
5,"A suggestion to the Whatsapp team , include a feature that an user can stop seeing the dp (profile photo) of any friend, without letting them know."
5,"Using everyday to call my friends, about security it's one of the best I ever using,easy to use, very nice app."
1,"I had a whatsapp account but, now that I try to put in a different phone with the same number I haven't been able to get the code to access it. I have contacted customer support and I followed their steps but, with no success. Every time I request a code it doesn't get delivered and it takes 1hr to get another which is very odd. I am very disappointed with this service. They always send same auto reply solution which I tried many times. This is the third day without whatapp access. Disappointed."
3,"quality of images or videos uploaded on status or sent to a friend ain't to good, the quality is always broken."
4,REACT?! Seriously? Lots of people spamming react resulting in unnecessary notification. Make a separate notification toggle for react so people who doesnt like the feature can turn its notif off.
5,"Excellent app, please add jump to date option, so we can search previous messages easily. Any update?"
5,"It is a very nice app,but I think status saving should be added to it,we should be able to save status from the app itself."
1,"I think better than changing the UI like that without users input, it's better to make ""themes"" so i can have it how i like it."
1,Why all the photos videos and document cant save dairect to gallery because of that lots of my photos and videos were gone from gallery cant find them even in whatsapp worse experience
1,"It is a very disgusting application. If you delete a message for everyone, GBWhatsApp's or other WhatsApp MOD application users can still see these deleted messages. So, why does WhatsApp provide this feature to its users when it doesn't work on other illegal WhatsApp applications?"
5,"It's was amazing to use the watsapp which helps to share photos share status which is most usefull us.In watsapp we can share with our friends,all over India and also world most of them use this app.we can chat with friends it was most beneficial for us."
3,"My WhatsApp keep telling me to download the normal Whatsapp version, and when I do that, it still repeats the same statement. I now cannot access my WhatsApp, please help."
5,"App is very slow and I hv sent many time report but no solution. It handed while forwarding message. Also schedule back ip does not occure. Its not possible for this review to attach Screenshot, otherwise I attach for your perysal."
3,I really love the new upgrades to the app but everytime I try to link my WhatsApp to my Facebook it says NO BROWSER AVAILABLE UNABLE TO PROCESS REQUEST... I would love it if this could be fixed
3,"This app is really good. But there is a problem when I uninstall this app, all the messages of my friend are deleted. Anyway the overall is very good."
3,"Hi Team, I have been using it for quite some time, and it's a friendly application, but now and then we are receiving spam calls and messages from unknown numbers as the contact is not in our phone book. I keep blocking the numbers, but the scammers are reaching with different numbers and making a lot of noise. If there is no solution for this issue and the  option is to uninstall the WhatsApp application, I hope WhatsApp is developing a solution to address these issues."
3,"Chats lock fuction is not work in my mobile, When I allow the chats lock button showing some thing error Please try to do some best for everyone so that everyone be happy from your application function. Thanks üôè"
1,"Terrible new update, slows down entire experience because now you have to wait for the animation to finish. Who comes up with such genius ideas?"
2,"It would be nice if Whatsapp improving their status picture and videos quality for uploading, the video quality supposed to be choose."
1,"Frustrating and useless. Admin of group insists they sent invite, but I can't find and have no way to search."
4,Very good almost in everything apart from group messaging that allows only 5 and that seems to be annoying since you HV hundreds of people to message
1,"It's so bad everytime I try to call someone it says "" ur wifi doesn't support whatsapp calls"" pls fix this and sometimes my messages don't send and my wifi is working fine pls fix this stupid update"
2,We can't personalise our Quick Responses messages for Samsung Watch 6. Whereas in Samsung Pro 5 Watch. We had no issues. Please advise Thanks
1,WhatsApp is not Instagram. The feature is quite annoying cause its turning WhatsApp to a social media app. I genuinely don't like the new update.

2,This app reduce the quality of my videos when I post them and it is not possible for me to show my friend a good quality video I have made please fix the video quality please
3,"I updated my WhatsApp now, it showed it has successfully finished downloading and Installing but the app didn't update, the new UI isn't there"
1,"WhatsApp was good before the update. After the update, when I go from text to emoji, nothing is the same. Very bad update"
4,"Very good app overall. I'm dissapointed however, that after so long we still can't upload the original quality of the media on our status"
5,"The app is really good. I mean, it allows you to make audio and video calls,interact with loved ones, send locations, this app does basically everything."
2,It is good app.But my account ban i don't know what was the reason. I use offical version of whatsapp .Whatsappp team did not unban my account. I give all proves to whatsapp. I request several times to whstsapp team but they can unban it. It is big bug kindly improve it.
2,"What's the deal with whatsapp compressing videos and ruining video quality,does compressing serve any purpose? it's annoying my 1080p HD video suddenly becomes blurry please remove this from the app"
1,"updates are getting worse and worse. Stop the new feature you have introduced ""channels"" It is of no use."
1,"encrypts your messages by default and its enormous user base makes it easy to connect with your friends and family, but its ownership by Facebook's Meta puts its status as a privacy-first messaging app in question."
2,Please improve the status update . The video got compress and make it blurry and ugly . Please put an option or whatever to keep the quality video or pictures at update status
2,"No need of this channel feature in status section because status directly not showing in first open what's app please remove this in next update because already we have 2 platform Facebook, Instagram"
5,"Brilliant text messaging App. It's the best Texting, Video calling and Voice calling App out there. I definitely recommend using this App. WhatsApp‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,"There'be been improvements but please go back to the old system where if someone sends u five dms u show the first message on the chat and not the last. Its important because if someone sends u 5 dms and u show the last message they sent it could be the most insignificant of all the five messages Little silly! Honey, honey we need u to come home quickly Okay And all u can see on the chat is okay and u think everything is fine wen its not! Please change this. I explained as best I could. Itsann"
1,The recent update is annoying.. l can't see the muted statuses which makes it impossible to unmute a status Is there a way somebody can go back to the previous version?
1,I faced a issue from a couple time. Whenever i post video status it loose its quality and ruin all video quality.
4,"No junk ads, acceptable encryption everywhere and great video calls. Though Telegram is better for privacy and overall quality, Whatsapp is acceptable for usual use."
5,"My WhatsApp is not working. What can I do? When I am installed any types of what like GB, WhatsApp messenger, &WhatsApp Business &want to add my account they showing this (you have the official to use this account ). It's not responding. My account block from 1 weak. What can I do now?"
3,"Nice app, but I would suggest a pop up to confirm chosen sticker to send. I do Click wrong stickers, sometimes, which sends immediately, if it would ask me to confirm, I think the issue will be sorted. Thanks for your time."
3,"kindly allow the settings privacy for profile picture just like status...""only share with"" should be an option...I mean with whom we're comfortable to show our dp.."
1,Too much Picture compression in status upload is irritating. I have clear picture in the gallery but when uploaded to status the picture getting too much blur
3,"It is a new version, i like it,but how can i see that the other person reacted to my text when i can't react to the person text.ü§ßüò∂üòëi just updated it,that's why."
1,This update suck. I mean really channels? What makes you think I want something like that in a freaking messenger? If I want that I would just go and used Insta and FB. Seriously this is supposed to be messenger. Kindly remained that way. Oh but wait even if there are consumers that hated it you guys would be ignore this because you know we still need this app in daily lives. Sorry 1 star from me until that so called channels gone.
4,"Everything thing fine until I download pics from phone, then I get a copy of every WhatsApp pic I have sent as well as album pic. Very annoying having to go through and delete"
5,This is a very good afternoon for everything very essential and very economical and very political for all on this app jo bhi aur chat with our family and all the family members and we can chat to our friend and we can chat home country is using this WhatsApp message for everyone and it is very useful app I give 5 star and with student working that this is not very good habit is very good design
1,Worst messenger of all times...date keeps changing continuously as we use vpn . Where the hell does this app receive date and time information from that cannot show the right time?
1,Not properly working. Many bugs was not clear and sometimes automatically closed app..üò§
5,"It's best app in the world üåç. I have been using this app since 2k17. You can do call, vice call, message and send photos, videos, sticker, otherwise you Enjoy your life on the WhatsApp üòâ"
1,"I can't register my phone numberü•≤ everytime after I click for the verification,it says I need to install the original/official WhatsAppüòê I tried everything for few days already~~~~"
1,Hate the new channel feature. App becomes more complex. Like it as simple to use.
5,Great up...only if developers come up with a way to be able to use without vpn..countries like Iran have blocked this great app and one can use only with vpn
5,I was the best app to connect with firend but in this world not any buddy is real only our parents were real in this life which given by god of world . this is good. It is very easy to use for all age groups of world above 10 year. Or on this time this app going fast .
3,Bring back the search button for statuses! It was taken away with this last update that introduced channels.
1,"The update wattapp is very stupid... Most of my messages can't send, they just hang telling me to try again. This is very very annoying"
3,"After few days I blocked some certain contacts, later it is unblocked even I didn't unblock them. Same issues experienced with my another Android phone. And another thing sometimes after sent messages, I experiencing long time after the recipient received or goes check my messages, or long time reconnecting. But with IOS phone doesn't have like this kind of issues. Please could you fix this, in soonest time. Thanks.."
1,"I'm following instructions given by the app to transfer my chats to my new phone, but once I log into the new phone, the old phone shut me out, so I cant complete the scan."
1,Auto Update app. But still video quality is very poor. Always blur video in WhatsApp video call..
1,"BRING BACK THE OLD EMOJI PATTERN (the latest update on the app for the emoji is just ridiculous,it's so irritating to use only I can't type properly or use any emoji and sticker)"
1,whatsapp should be able to retrieve all the chat from Iphone & Android. When I moved to iphone I lost all the chats. and now again I moved to Android mobile and again lost the chats.
1,"After update some channels and all features came in status which irritate me alot and also I can't find any option to remove it,pls check out"
1,I think the new channel thing should be in a different column not in the same one with status because it's taking up space and I can't view my fifth post without going through the whole previous posts
1,"No company can force its users to have a default app, WhatsApp, what new thing have you started - I don't need that channel. To delete this just give the option No HIDE Option Plz thanks."
4,I think WhatsApp should have status grouping function in which user can group a particular status for a group and another status for another group. This function make WhatsApp more functionally. Thank you.
2,The only issue with what'sapp so far is because of low quality when it comes to picture. WhatsApp automatically reduce your image quality please look how Twitter and telegram do it perfect
2,After the new update the typing bar amd emoji bar is in two opposite sides of the screen one on top of the screen and the other at bottom which makes the UX very bad
2,"new whatsapp feature ""channels"" is stupid. just add an option to disable it, almost everyone hates it. everytime you update the app it takes a step back. stupid asl"
1,They banned me on WhatsApp after a friend of mine sent me 30 images and called it spamming. This was so irrational cause I even rarely text anyone nor send unnecessary text to anyone. Füñïüèæ support.
1,It does not work. A issue is created that the whatsapp is off for 24 hours. My work is most important on this app plz help me for rating
2,"Finally, whatsapp for wear os is here.but the app is half baked.Watch still vibrates and shows notifications even you are using the phone in hand.it is very annoying and drains battery without any reason."
3,"There are many problem in this app, such as , if one's didn't download one's file then later WhatsApp didn't permission to download that file. So please solve this problem."
4,Why can't I post some videos on my status. This thing started after the update. I can't post certain videos on my status and they are not bad too.
5,"I am using Wattsapp since 1992 and its very good programming and service. Very helpful , eezzee communication all the time to all world friends. Even family outside the country Othet country felliw very eezee connection. Blessing for all.üò≥ü§≤üçäüíöüë¨üêáü•¶ü•íüåΩüç∞üç¶"
3,"I have been getting issues with my WhatsApp not working properly when it comes to statuses, as long as they are videos they wont play. Same with chats , if people send me videos I'm unable to watch them bc my WhatsApp won't download it. No matter how many times i tried or uninstall to reinstall again still the same issue. Hope this bug get fixed. Thank you."
5,It has been a very commendable means of communication especially international calls. Well done whatsapp. More grace of effective performance.
1,Update on the 'updates feature'. Why would you replace the status with the updates? Now I have to click on the three dots to view status? How troublesome!
1,Ur what's app channels feature is very obsean and offensive......kindly stop this channels updates. I will report against this unwanted and obsean channels which comes in my what's app status.

1,"Why do you guys keep banning my number, I can't even chat with my friends anymore, I reported and it seems like you had it covered but I couldn't log in, always telling to use the official WhatsApp, is this not the official WhatsApp, what is wrong with your customer services. It's very poor."
4,"Whatsapp is a great app, but you can make its graphics a little more extraordinary, then it will be more fun. Thank you !"
3,I'm having a bug...the whole status page automatically disappear before 24 hrs..hope the management will solve this problem soon... Thanks.

Thank you. I need a clear answer of what to do to regain my WhatsApp Platform and been able to use it again."
1,My boss added me to the work WhatsApp group and now everyone at work has my number. I don't want my number to be shared to people I don't know. I do not know everyone at work and I certainly don't have all their numbers in my contacts! I haven't given WhatsApp permission to share my number in this manner. This is a security issue!
1,I don't have any problem of this app but the quality of the videos and pictures was decreasing while we upload to the WhatsApp status .....so please fix this problem as soon as possible....
1,"Very bad exprience of whatsapp not able to install due to an error ""need to instal official watsapp"" I don't understand what is that I use to watsapp since long time now it's not working do the needfull."
4,"Please make a feature that allows users to group stickers into folders, this will make the stickers easy to find when the number of stickers owned is very high."
5,"I love this application but it the problem is that it quickly gets outdated,and the more updates you get is the more space it takes on your mobile device."
4,"Is wonderful and beautiful just normal but let it be updated for new future like seeing those online showing at the corner, and new methods."
1,Very very bad experience.....it needs very irregular updatation...my account is not working....they said they reviewd and without giving any reason or based on any reason they blocked my acount.... ...
1,"This was a good app... But idk why WhatsApp is just banning my account again and again, even though I haven't don't anything like spamming or something else... Hope you will permanently unban my account ASAP, for smooth usage of the app."
2,"Whatsapp is a good communication app. But I can not use it. I use the oppo f1s phone. When I open whatsapp on it, after typing my number, it says you need the official whatsapp. Please someone kindly fix it."
4,We are unable to use WhatsApp from today morning. pl support What is the problem Almost a day is over. How long we have to wait. To much taking time to resolve. Not acceptable Same problem again reported from 6am today. Tried now & same problem. Really I am fed up.pl re install my no.
3,"It's a good app, but it has some major issues. One of them is that the app doesn't let me pin more than 3 chats. Well, i have more than 3 goto chats and I need them daily, but i have to choose between them. The other one is that whenever you delete the message, you see the ""...deleted message"". Think about it if you wanted everyone to see the message, you wouldn't delete it."
5,Obviously very good app no hanging problems no ads and good for messaging privately and video calls if someone is leaving far from us we can see there faces and talk to them by seeing faces
3,"The watch notifications for the wearOS version is really slow, using the phone notifications is certainly better"
5,"The watch app is the best, it does what it says it does and what it should do. I just wish there was a way to manage notification now that now the app is both on my phone and app, you find it notifies me 3 times for the same thing. I get a message the notification goes through on my phone, then the notification goes to my watch that there's a notification for whatsapp on my phone, then I get a notification for whatsapp on my watch."
1,I am still so very unhappy about this. My account has been blocked by WhatsApp and all effort to retrieve it has been abortive. I am an elderly woman and this is where I communicate with my friends and families. This act is not encouraging at all. Unblock my account
1,"When we upload status. Photo quality immediately down. It poor quality app You need to update that, after updating app new version also status quality poor"
1,Oppo A7 has contacts reading issues. Kindly fix the same. Re-enabling the permission is just a temporary solution.
1,"This is just SAD and FRUSTRATING I keep downloading and updating my WhatsApp here on Playstore, yet I keep getting blocked for not using an 'official' WhatsApp account. What am I doing wrong? Is this a FAKE Google playstore platform? After all these years? I wish I could just get a 24-hour access so I can notify my family, relatives, friends and business associates to download an alternative app where we can keep in touch. Maybe this app isn't for me anymore; after all, I am just 1 person."
1,Dear what's ap can you plz get back the old what's app because after updating the app the keyboard has changed and using imoji has became so annoying and typing has became so annoying for me plz üòî fix the keyboard as it was before..

4,"There's no notification if someone reacts to my msg .. y'all need to improve this system..also please increase the status time from 30sec to 1 min..make WhatsApp available in all colours everyone doesn't like ""green"""
4,Nice messaging app . It good and very fast but have only one problem . Just want it to have time ability to take long videos on status
4,"I don't know why people are giving less than 3stars cos Whatsapp is a very reliable and unique app. The only problem I have is that it reduces the quality of images which I understand because they are trying to optimize it to avoid excessive data consumption. But every thing else is top notch. Infact you can even share your location to who you want to, with new updates you can use poll and other features to make group chats more fun and lively, and to also get choices from your contacts."
3,"Okay, its just weird. On my galery, my photo should 150, but why on whatsapp only 60? Dude, where's all my photo? I keep sending my photo to only my number chat, and it was in there the whatsapp open galery, but why in other album on whatsapp still 60? Please what happend? If this is from the whatsapp please fix it now!"
1,"The beauty of Whatsapp was the fact that it was simple, and it's functionalities were clear. Adding more stuff to it will certainly make it worse."
4,"It amazing nowadays to use messenger but on one condition,why can't you update it in a such a way that if you send a message and you unsend it should not be message deleted"
4,Good üëç But now i found it to hear the audio if anyone sent me an audio. Is so fast and i can even understand the voice waa it the setting on the app or from my phone ?
5,"The option for video recording in the chat section is nice, as you can now flip between video and audio"
1,WhatsApp open issue after very long time and we are try to replace the sim card also but message recived from WhatsApp number not varify. Please resolve the issue.
4,"Nowadays WhatsApp added many helpful features. And safe useable. But I give 4 star because in some cases WhatsApp copy others. I know the others which I told it's belongs to Meta,but this are other. So I hope that in the next update WhatsApp rearrange the copied features. But, yes one more time I say it that some features are very helpful. Thank WhatsApp for this co-operation. ‚ò∫üòÑ At last sorry for excise talk."
1,"I don't like the instant video record, also I don't like all the stickers and emojis now appears in the low part, pls take them back to their original place!"
1,In thip app always asking for update and useless update are coming and that's are also borring updated.. new channels features in WhatsApp is also useless for us.. plz remove channel update üòî
1,For the new update I'll rate it poor because it's feels lag and uneasy to use the emojis while writing text we want our previous WhatsApp we don't want more updates just do normal'as it was!!!!
4,"I were using this app for almost six to seven years, and from that much experience I would say it is the best app for chat and calling, it also has media sharing, file sharing, and links also, the main part is that this app has the great calling quality, no matter the person is from where, if they have a good network then the quality is great always, no bug issues, and also it has storage warning and clearing facility, and it has the disappearing mode, and so we can easily clear effortlessl"
1,"Hello I've tried updating my WhatsApp and for reasons best known to Whatsapp, they have decided not to update my app after several times of updating the app This sucks a lot ! Please work on it ASAP üôè"
1,With recent voice message my phone started taking up pocket mode every time i unlock it.... it was working flawless before that.... Need to shift to telegram now
1,I hate the bottom navigation bar. Please undo this useless update that serves no purpose other than frustrating me and many other daily users. It just looks ugly and odd
2,"When I post a status, my video quality becomes broken and blurry when the quality is actually good. This app is a shame and I still use it because people use it too"
1,"I used to have no issues with whatsapp, But there new sticker emoji tray is the worst improvement they ever made it is so slow it completely ruins the whole experience üôÑüò°"
1,The announcement/community group chats are very annoying. I always like to keep my WhatsApp home page free by archiving the unnecessary chats & groups but this unarchive-able feature i hate it.
5,"How do I share a message? Because the number is not saved. Then I have to come back and save the number or scan and open the number, only then I can send it, why is there no option to scan the number while sharing?"
5,The app is good but can u also add face lock just like the fingerprint And also need to stop hackers looking for WhatsApp account to hack into. My account was hacked so I had to create another one
4,It's really great to chat with girls and also friends. This app helps to find more girlfriends but still I don't have any girlfriends ü•∫ if I can found a girlfriend I will give you 5 star rating
1,"Chat lock function should not be opened by pin, unauthorized access is still possible. It should be opened only by finger print."
5,I love this app the network is really good and lovely I over well for audio call and video the app is the best I really love it and I appreciate the one who brings this app I really like it you can use it to rich your family you have not hard from for years or times thanks to the bringer of this app I so much appreciate God bless you and continue to do so AMEN

1,"App keeps telling me to rate it, so here goes. I was forced to have this on my phone in order to enter indonesia and it is owned by the worlds biggest liar mark suckerburg. Thankyou."
1,I tried to access my account many times but I was logged out. It says am not using official Whatsapp whilst I am. It's very frustrating. Please do something about it.
1,A horrible experience...can't search for Status and other Navigations and stuffs are all wack and not making sense at all
4,Overall it's a reliable app. Please add a feature of selecting multiple messages by dragging on screen
1,Dear whatsapp team There is a issue bugging me from a long time. My account was banned even I haven't violated any policy or condition. I sended a email and even received one telling me that my account was unbanned but I the same didn't happend so. So here I am all frustrated. Please show some deserve concern to this issue.
4,"Archived messages could be at the bottom of message list or somewhere in settings. If I archived them, I don't want to see them üòÑ"

1,Dear whatsapp support team my whatsapp is not working properly from afternoon when I open the app Application automatically closed kindly reslove the issue as soon as possible.
1,This new version of WhatsApp is just worst. Please leave WhatsApp as a simple messanger app and stop this channels and all ... it's really irritating like seriously whyyy????
5,"This is a great app. I see it as better than the built-in phone calling feature as with just Wifi one can make cheap overseas calls. But, I have a bug/glitch report: sometimes when Whatsapp is opened and i unlock my phone, the chat would show in messages from some time ago instead of the lastest messages at the bottom of the list of messages. Update 2023-04-26: Pls add the feature of letting me edit the messages I sent."
5,It's quite easy drop informations Its very confidential. forward messages fast. Extremely enjoyable. Safe cost.
4,"It's a very good APP for communication. There is one problem though and that is without using the newest update, users get threatened with the APP becoming useless until updated, and there is a countdown. Google Play is not available in some countries. Why not do like VPN providers and authorize some rotating weblinks to download the updates from? If the purpose is to provide a useful application then please make it available to anyone, not only Google Play users. Thanks."
4,"Hi I'm facing an issue with my number. There is a misunderstanding I'm using Whatsapp official app. But a notification appears ""you are using unofficial app that's why your number is band"" !!! I'm not using any unofficial app"
3,Please change tha chat Lock privacy . If my fingerprint is not working i have to add Lock screen password and that is worst option because it is not private then üôÑ please change it
1,Whenever i try to listen to an audio without earphones which someone send me i am not able to listen to it the screen gets black when i try to listen to it.whenever i try to record an audio my voice doesn't get in the audio i have checked my speaker to nothing wrong with it i restarted my phone to but still the same issues its this apps issue

2,My WhatsApp is not working. It seems to have an error in verification while logging in in any device. Please resolve my issue immediately.
2,This new update with channels is annoying. Get rid of channels or make it optional!
1,I'm taking this to one star because the app suddenly closed down and wiped out every single chat I had. I've lost a lot of information so I'm quite disheartened even.
3,Also add option of edit status....when we put status and want to some changes on this then easily edit status without removing or creating new status.
3,"Preferred the old update where I can see the status update of my contact, where in the latest update, I can't view their status. Will change once I can see my friends status update"
1,Give us the old keyboard style back...the new one sucks...it gets more difficult somehow to send stickers...can't even make fun of my friends rapidly.
3,"My video call isn't workingüòîüòî Edit: It's already working but my *Share live location* isn't working Chats delete by themselves, sometimes my WA just stops working and other apps with internet are working fineüöÆ"
2,Dammmm whatsapp ....why it automatically syn contact from google account without my consent ..now I can't even delete unwanted contact number from whatsapp .... developer please look into this matter and don't include automatic contact sync from google account ....
1,It's the worst communication app I have ever used. At first when I opened WhatsApp it blocked my number and then it showed to register a new number. So I bought a new number. Then again it showed me that we have blocked your account. So WhatsApp please solve my issue. üôèüôè
4,‚ñ™Ô∏éAdd pop-up notification for higher Android versions! ‚ñ™Ô∏éMake the ability to call/text somebody without adding them to contacts!
5,"The whatsapp is a very good app. I am chating with my friends or relatives. I call my friends or video call and the whatsapp is very helpful and useful . The whatsapp is good for private disscustion. Thank""s for make whatsapp."
2,"In search after long typing & clicking on 1 of the results, all the search results disappear when we go back and have again do the long typing.. Please FIX IT."
1,My previous phone is not working and I get a new phone but on unable to add my number to whats app help me to fix it. I don't have access to the verification code.
4,Need to have languages translator facility in the set-up. To enable easy foreign communication.
2,"Upload a 1 min video on status screen, observe that 1st 30 second video uploaded successfully and then try to upload rest 30 sec and observe there video is not uploaded getting error message."
1,"Atrocious ease of installation.Shound not be made to receive an SMS , particularly if mobile reception is poor. Ease of installation needs looking at."
3,Can't store to SD card. Internal storage is limited. Please add default to save to micro SD/external storage and also allow app to run from external storage/micro SD.
1,New UI is bad. Change new user interface. Old was good New user interface is not friendly
5,Thanks for the update and it lit.....now I would suggest that let people be able to pin status and also the channels as a many as possible And I will also like to inquire on how one can create a channel
2,From the last 2 days I am facing the issue with the whatsapp last seen privacy option I am hiding my last seen from some people even then they are able to see my lastseen I don't know what is the issue with the whatsapp.
1,"Permissions glitch. Since updating my phone it wont let me go into any of my folders to upload anything, keeps saying to allow permissions for photos ect but they are all allowed and selected. How could such a basic function issue not get picked up on patch testing????"
5,It is great app but nowadays it's having bug while uploading status like... After uploading video or photo the pixels get exploded... Hope this it will sort out soon by your side
1,The latest update is so annoying especially for that status and channel section..why can't I delete multiple statuses at once
4,"The app is good, but I do suggest there should be some development in reading messages, should cope telegram form of reading messages, whereby when I read messages in group chat and I exit should commence where I ended once I resume in a group"
5,The last update make the stickers section very unconfortable. It takes seconds to move between groups of stickers if you have several of them.
1,"Photos' quality option is set to ""Best Quality"" but WhatsApp still reduces the quality to such a bad one that I feel bad to send it to others and putting any photo as status, it just blurres out the quality. WhatsApp team should look into this.. I am reducing the stars since this is a serious problem. Still not rectified..."
4,"It works, but it takes long to set up and always say thing went wrong. It is a great way to chat with friends and family"
4,Whatsapp lacks the feature of notifying a new Whatsapp user out of consumers existing contacts/phonebook. Such a feature in telegram does give it an edge over Whatsapp. Whatsapp should definitely incorporate such high end intelligent features to keep out with nowadays consumer needs.
2,"It works well with messages and pictures, but the app is annoying me when I post a video it's won't play keeps on skipping till it stops halfway"
1,"I used to love this app but the recent updates destroyed it. The sticker, GIF, emoji area update has made it much harder to navigate."
4,Should have the feature @all for mentioning everyone in the group. WhatsApp should add the must have feature where people not in your contact list cannot add you to Groups
2,"Hate the new update to layout it feels terrible and frustrating the original was so much better, why fix what's not broke. Do better."
4,"It's a good app but a pin feature would be nice, a pin for an announcement and stuff like that would optimise the app better"
3,"Upload photo to status always blurry on my z flip 5...before this i am using iphone 14 pro max and never have this problem, and never face this problem on my older iphone too"
2,"Last update is buggy. Text field doesn't expand when I type more than one line, animated emoticon area is useless."
1,"While uploading a video on status in Android, WhatsApp automatically compresses the video, so the quality of the video becomes worse, which is useless."
1,WhatsApp is no more a text messaging app. Hated the channel feature. Had to find some alternative now.
2,This tab written channels is irritating..It makes WhatsApp look like a social app and less private unlike before....Are the chats really end to end encrypted as at 2023?..Kindly shut down the channels area..it's less helpful . Thanks
4,"Hi WhatsApp team‚ò∫Ô∏è I have a suggestion heree...So if you could make another new features for Whatsapp, I would love to have a highlight feature to keep my statusüòå It would be so cool"
5,"A very good App. I enjoy using it because I haven't yet encountered any problems. It is smart, reliable and friendly."
5,Great app in general but please move the header to the footer. Today's smartphone are long and it's hard to search something or to switch to calls üôè
5,"Excellent, less expensive,can reach many people at once. A good advertising platform and many many more other benefits"
3,"I've been using Whatsapp for many years to keep in touch with my boyfriend in Sweden and friends in other countries and it was always great, but lately, there are a lot of issues. Like when my OS updated, nobody could hear me. I had to reset my phone to factory and opt out of the update to fix the issue. Not as great as it once was, but still good."
1,Adding channels in status is the worst decision WhatsApp has made till date... Wondering how to revert the updateüòî.. Hope Atleast WhatsApp remains a personal messaging platform ü§û-1 stars for this add-on
3,"Whenever i wanted to call someone. It always unreachable. Except for if that person was online in whatsapp. If offline means, it wont reach that person."
1,What kind of Update it is. You can't even see your starred messages. always when i try to see it notification flashes WHATSAPP ISN'T RESPONDING . Mad me mad seriously üòÆ‚Äçüí®
4,"Good app, but I want to see in the search option, all the groups that I have in my WhatsApp, please include this option, thanks"
3,The new update really sucks. The previous panel of statuses was better and we were able to search.
4,"Every time I have to uninstall this app. Please give us ""logout"" option. So that we can easily log out for sometime time."
1,"My screen is showing safe mode and I cannot see my WhatsApp and still confused, the application is gone and I'm confused."
3,It's a problem that Whatsapp uses internal storage of phone. If not then it will be more popular.
2,"My navigation bar has come below , pls bring it back on top . Chat , calls , status everything should be on top , not bottom. Please help."
3,"After latest update, WhatsApp always says poor connection on video calls. All other apps have no connection issues. Pl help"
4,"I have one suggestion.. If the translating option with different languages is available in this app while typing, then it will be more useful."
1,After updated whatsapp. Some important options not available. Status search button. And my status mark and delete button 3 dots button. Very important
1,Hi whatsapp tean! My app creat technical issues my account is didn't login & didn't recieved my verification code I requested you please solve my issues beacuse my all activity is disturbed for in this problem so kindlly quickly solve my problem Thank you whatsapp team....!
1,"Work on quality retention of files sent or received especially videos and pictures It's too bad, most people are migrating to telegram because they retain the quality of sent files"
1,"Useless new update I don't wanna this app now if you are doing this types of updates in this app. Only this one app was secure and safe but These new features like channel, etc. Not required üòëüòëüòë"
1,"The archive and chat lock features are just a waste! Archiving and locking chats means that they're hidden for a reason. What's the point of showing an icon for the folders in the main tab - on top, actually!? They're of no use!"
4,This application is really great and easy to use not just for some specific people though everyone. And that's what makes this app a great platform for messengers!
2,"The new update ""channel"" really disturbing status UI. Why put channel under the status? Please make another part for channel. It really disgusting"
5,What'sApp is a good app for messaging and calling but there is a problem when I send a photo or video to some one it become blur I request you to solve this problem please.
1,These guys are not working on bugs it's whenever I am trying to register it's shows kindly register in official WhatsApp only even I am registering on official WhatsApp itself frustrating wasting time huge loss for my business due to this issue..
1,There is a problem in audio messages can't listen to it properly. Phone is getting hanged.
3,"I enjoy using WhatsApp a lot. Its so easy and simple to navigate through. However, may you divide chats from groups."
1,Most of the time mic stops working. Unable to send voice. What could be the reason?
4,The app is so fine but I propose the developer to remove the feature of showing that someone left a group that features really discourages fellow member who want to stay.
1,"I am giving 1 star because from so many days my whatsApp account has deactivated and saying your number has not verified and whenever I try to login it's shows use official app Or website while I am using the official app from playstore still it's showing the same I am frustated now my all important messages are stucked because of these,üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†"
1,Whoever designed that new transition from keyboard to emojis... No. Just no. It is so annoying it makes me want to quit WhatsApp altogether.
4,Every thing is on its peak and thanks for giving us all that features But we are facing voice call issues even after updates It's not like that we have network issue but we are facing problems please fix it
1,I am gonna uninstall this app please in next update add a new feature in which we can share photos in sequence manner whenvever i send something to my friend the photos get jumbled .
1,"Getting message again and again ""This accout can not use whatsApp"" Even after requesting multiple reviews and sending emails no appreciate assistance provided by whatsApp team."
2,"Latest format of the status section which updated to be update section is extremely annoying, I liked the previous preview of status without open them"
5,Nice to send messages and document within no time.But I request you to kindly extend limit of 5 times. Again and again I have to repeat 5and 5 and so on and so forth.pl llok in to.
3,The status quality is not very good. I have upload a video on my status it decreases the video quality . This needs an improvement .
1,After the last update I cannot play any audio or video files received. Its just getting stuck.
2,"I humbel request to this app developer.. like gb WhatsApp settings we need ,and in this app the personal chat we want to hide ,its not available option üòî.we need quick finger print its not not working immediately.fonts,chats, lock maker, chat locker,chat hider, this type off update you have to bring ,i request to check my dm msg.

5,I am using an oppo A57 phone and it has since misbehaved hence leading to my account been blocked. I was requested to use a different number but all together the whatsapp accounts have been banned for reasons I am not aware of for I have never violated the terms and conditions by posting any bad material. I have noticed that most people using the same type of phone are having similar challenges. Kindly review this matter and restore my account promptly
4,It would be good if you bring the font colours in what's up. Then it will look attractive to those who use what's up.
5,So useful app . I've ben using since long . It saves lot of money . Easy to talk and share fotos and video with friends and family .
4,"Great app, problem with the new Community Feature, though. I wanted to group all my family groups in one place, so I made a Community. BIG MISTAKE. Everyone in every group can see the names of every group in the community. The 'Angela's Not inThis Group' group got a lot of laughs from everyone but Angela. There were several like this. I want to group my groups without that meaning everyone knows all my groups I'm in. Please make a feature that is less of a community. Thank you!"
5,"Very nice easy to use, but one thing I would like to say that when I share something only , i can share only 5 person. I like to share more then 5 persons. Thank you"
1,"Please even since I have update my WhatsApp, it is not working properly again and I don't know while my account is always on check review to know if I viloate your term and conditions which I didn't do I can check my messages all because your app is not functioning properly Check my review and please find solution to it Cause I don't know why you always mistakenly red flag my account"
1,Yes downloaded this app didn't realize you have a phone number that's have a phone number then what's it for anyways since you switched your other messenger over it's non usable so I needed something to get a hold of the people I know so thanks for not working either
1,"I dont like the new update ,why we have to follow channels same like insta or other app. This is ridiculous for WhatsApp, even we cannot hide it."
2,Supposed to be private but it's littered with scammers randomly messaging you all the time! No privacy in the time I've used this app.
5,"I loooove the new UI, it'll take a little bit of use to but please don't ever change it, its about time for some major changes!!!"
4,Good experience at all but finding difficult to send more videos it takes more time to preview and takes a huge amount of time ‚è≤Ô∏è
